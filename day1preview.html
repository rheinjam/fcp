      Utah Jazz vs. New Orleans Pelicans
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The Jazz and Pelicans kick off the restart of the NBA season. The big storyline to watch is how Zion will play, especially after leaving the bubble for several days and missing all of his scrimmage games. I’m sure that he has remained in great shape, but when every game matters for the Pelicans they can’t afford for him to not be at his best. Lonzo and Ingram looked sharp in the little of the Pelicans I watched over the last week. They are an exciting young team to watch and there are many inside and outside of the NBA hoping that they claim the 8 seed and meet Lebron in round 1.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The Utah Jazz are missing a key piece in Bojan Bogdanovic, whose shooting and on-court I.Q. will be missed. Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert have supposedly fixed their relationship, but this first game will be telling of the reality of their mending. The Jazz are expected to be a solid squad and compete, but I can’t see them making it out of the first round. The other teams in the West seem too talented for the short-handed Jazz to make much noise come playoff time.

      Los Angeles Lakers vs. Los Angeles Clippers
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      If you aren’t excited about this one I don’t know which game you are going to be excited about. The two highest seeded teams in the Western Conference are going head to head and every time they’ve met has been entertaining thus far. The star players will all be there, but the Clippers will not be at full strength. Lou Williams made some highly questionable choices and is now going to miss several games, and Beverly/Shamet just got back to the bubble.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Lebron/Davis and George/Leonard all played very well in the scrimmage games, and is part of the reason this game is so intriguing. How will they look when they go head to head with each other? The Lakers have less to play for because they have all but locked up the one seed, but the Clippers could potentially slip down several seeds. I’m thinking the Lakers will take this one because they will be at near full strength, while the Clippers will be missing their best bench player (Williams) and defender (Beverly).
