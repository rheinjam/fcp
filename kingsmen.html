    By James Rhein
    <p class="article">
      When the season was suspended on March 11th, Lebron James was playing his best basketball of the season. Victories in March against the Bucks and Clippers were in large part due to his efforts. He guarded the best player on the floor and was an offensive powerhouse, while still maintaining his league high assist numbers. Against the Bucks in particular, he almost single handedly shut down Giannis Antekounmpo. Up until that point Antekounmpo had been the MVP favorite, but Lebron was starting to change the narrative. Under Lebron’s leadership, a team full of players no one wanted was exceeding expectations. Now months later, the loss of a few players and extended time without playing, has people questioning both depth and team chemistry.
    </p>

      Let’s start with Rondo. His injury is getting lots of attention because it’s the Lakers. People are forgetting that Rondo is a defensive liability, and still is not as good of a shooter as most guards in the league. His playmaking ability, especially when <a class="video-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W_lEUAvhR0">both he and Lebron were on the floor</a>, will be missed. Alex Caruso and Quinn Cook will now get extended minutes to make up for Rondo’s injury. Caruso is underrated and his athleticism and playmaking ability will be shown more in Orlando. Cook, on the other hand, has the playoff experience from his time with the Warriors. While you never know what you are going to get in terms of offensive output, he can run point effectively and hustles.

      Avery Bradley has decided not to go to Orlando. Being their best on ball defender, this is going to hurt the Lakers more than the loss of Rondo. Having someone that each night would play with hustle and heart is hard to come by. He will not be able to be replaced on the defensive end. Adding J.R. Smith is a replacement I can get behind. Surrounding James and Davis with more shooters will definitely help in the modern N.B.A. Smith can get hot, and
      <a class="video-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP7KywgzofA">has playoff experience that most players on the team do not.</a>

      Depth is the question on everyone’s mind when it comes to this team. Not just because of the aforementioned Rondo injury, but because of the strength of second units on other teams. The Clippers and Bucks defense could simply exhaust the Lakers if the playoffs go the way everyone thinks it’s going to. Back to back rounds against such deep teams could prove to be too exhausting. A well rested Lebron is going to play extended minutes, and having Davis helps significantly, but who else can they turn to?
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Kuzma is often talked about as the third piece of the Lakers, but injuries and inconsistent play have led a lot of people to question his ceiling. KCP and Danny Green have been underwhelming to say the least. Howard and McGee are solid bench players, but rely on others to set them up at the offensive end. When they are going against teams that can guard all positions man to man, the onus will fall on Lebron and Davis to carry night in and night out. One could also make this argument for the Bucks or Clippers, saying that Antekounmpo or Leonard has to carry their respective teams. Yes, but I feel as though their teammates could get them a victory or two in a playoff game if they don’t play well. I don’t trust any Lakers to have a great game under the pressure of later playoff rounds.

      Team chemistry is a concern for all teams headed to the bubble. The Lakers were locked in before the season was suspended. The 8 games before the playoffs and having practice time will obviously help, but with new teammates and different players getting extra minutes this team could look quite different. The Lakers had arguably the best chemistry in the league to start the season and weren’t that far off from that mark as the season continued. This feels like a new season to me because the suspension lasted as long as the normal in-between season break. Four months can make a world of difference, so it be interesting to see how the Lakers handle it. Will having Danny Green and KCP start work? Will the second unit hold together with Caruso and Cook leading the way? Time will tell.
