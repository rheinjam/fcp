      Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      This has been the most exciting one on one battle in a playoff series that I can remember in my lifetime. Donovan Mitchell going head to head against Jamal Murray. Both have had incredible games for their teams. Murray looked out of sorts and his usual self at the beginning of the series, but the last games have shown what he is capable of. Mitchell has also stayed red hot, but that hasn’t stopped the Nuggets from winning both games five and six and evening up this series.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The Jazz need to get back to playing at a high level and figuring out some way of containing Murray. The problem is that if Murray is doubled he can kick it to Jokic who is likely the best passing big in the league. From there he has options and puts the Jazz defense at a disadvantage. If I’m the Jazz I’m looking to go to Gobert early and often in hopes of getting Jokic in early foul trouble. This could allow them to play much better defense on Murray, and put themselves in a spot to take it home. Tonight is the night. One team will move on to play the Clippers, and one will leave the bubble.

    <p class="articleheading">
      Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Houston Rockets
    </p>
    <p class="article">
    Welp. Classic Westbrook. He was overly aggressive in game six and turned the ball over several times in the fourth quarter. Chris Paul came up clutch down the stretch, and for some reason the ball was not in Harden’s hands at the end of the game. If the Rockets lose again, it’s another blemish on James Harden’s playoff career. He will continue to be known as a great scorer that can’t make it to the finals. As someone who dislikes the Rockets more than any team in recent memory, I will be actively rooting for the Thunder.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
The Thunder will continue to rely on Chris Paul’s leadership to lead them into the next round. Schroder and Alexander have been good during points of this series, but really need to come to play in game seven. Playoff experience is strong with both squads, especially the Rockets. They’ve been in game sevens in recent years, but often they come up short. Anything can happen in a deciding game, and we will be discussing both on the Quarter by Quarter podcast this Thursday!
