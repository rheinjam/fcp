      As NBA bloggers, we do our best to not only provide predictions and analysis of the current basketball landscape, but to also present a snapshot of the league to be preserved until the end of time (or until artificial intelligence or nuclear war wipe us all out, but that’s a topic for a different post).. Much to our horror, these snapshots can also serve as time capsules of ignorance and incompetence. One such time capsule my eastern conference playoff preview piece, wherein I revealed my ignorance regarding the player that has set the Orlando bubble on fire: T.J. Warren. Doing a deeper dive, I realized that not only has this man been lighting it up in Orlando, he’s been getting efficient buckets for years. To T.J., I am sorry for overlooking your skills. I am ashamed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
      Warren’s Orlando bubble stats are well-documented, but as a reminder: he’s averaging 34.8 points per game on 60.8% shooting and 55.6% from three-point range. He dropped 53 points in his first bubble game, a win over Philadelphia, and just bookended that performance with 39 points on the Lakers, one of the league’s best defensive teams. The Pacers are 4-1 in bubble play despite losing all-star power forward Domantas Sabonis to a bout of plantar fasciitis. T.J. has only had one slip-up, a 16-point, 7-20 shooting performance in a loss against the blazing hot Phoenix Suns. For the season, he is now averaging 19.9 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field and 40.5% from three.

      How does a player capable of such elite offensive output fly under the radar for so long? These types of numbers are normally reserved for the big names the NBA Borg expects to dominate the hardwood; the Hardens, Durants, LeBrons. It took an almost perfect series of events for this to occur. First, Warren played his college ball at NC State. A five-star recruit out of Brewster Academy in Durham, NC, Warren spurned traditional powers like UNC, Kansas, and Kentucky to play for the Wolfpack. In his freshmen season, Warren averaged 12.1 ppg and was named to the ACC all-freshmen team. NC State had some success that first year, going 24-11 and upsetting #1 Duke, but lost in disappointing fashion to Temple in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p class="article">
      Warren broke out in the 2012-13 season, wherein he averaged 24.9 points and 7.1 rebounds and won ACC Player of the Year. Unfortunately, the Wolfpack again lost in the second round of the big dance, falling to St. Louis. Despite individual stats and success, the Wolfpack never made it to an ACC tournament final and never advanced past the second round of the NCAAs. “Bigger” programs like Duke, UNC, and Virginia continued to dominate the headlines. T.J. then took his talents to the NBA and Phoenix drafted him 14th overall in the 2014 Draft (sandwiched between Zach LaVine and Adreian Payne).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
      Warren seldom played his rookie year, suffering a cracked bone in his thumb and toiling in the D-League on multiple occasions. The 2015-16 season was better for Warren, who was building momentum as an efficient scorer for the Suns until he suffered a season-ending foot injury in December of 2015. From there, he would average 19.6 and 18.0 points per game for the Suns in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. While he was a promising young player, Phoenix was terrible in Warren’s best two seasons with the team, winning 21 and 19 games respectively in the 17-18 and 18-19 seasons. Phoenix’ incompetence sparked a legendary Charles Barkley rant about the quality of the Phoenix nachos, dirtiness of their seats, and an acknowledgement of the ample parking availability. Throw in Warren playing in the shadow of young superstar Devin Booker, and it’s easy to see why T.J. has not received the proper notoriety during his time in the NBA. Phoenix would go on to trade Warren and the #32 pick for mere cash considerations to the Indiana Pacers in June of 2019, looking to clear cap space. The disrespect!

    <p class="article">
      But why the sudden surge to the top of the bubble scoring ranks, you ask? In Indiana this season, Tony Buckets continued his efficient scoring while solidifying a key aspect of his game he improved upon during his time in Phoenix- his three-point shot. Through the end of the 17-18 season, Warren had never shot more than 1.5 threes per game and was shooting a paltry 22.2% from distance that season. In 2018-19 (albeit in only 43 games played), Warren shot 42.8% from three on 4.2 attempts per game and has continued that 40%-plus output into this season. Sprinkle in the recent injury to Domantas Sabonis and some hard work during the lockdown, and it becomes clear that Warren just needed an opportunity to flourish.
    </p>

    <p class="article">
      Again, T.J., I am sorry. I just didn’t know you existed. It’s not my fault the Suns were hardly ever on national TV. Another apology is due to the Pacers. Without Sabonis and with a hobbled Victor Oladipo, I pegged you for a first-round exit. Allow me to amend that prediction. If Warren even plays 80% as well as he has been playing, Indiana can make life very difficult for most of the teams in the East. A first-round matchup with the Heat seems likely. While I don’t believe this Indiana team is capable of beating a Milwaukee, Toronto, or Boston, I like their chances against the three-point bombing Heat, and the majesty of Warren’s recent play is a big reason why. One man’s cap space is another man’s treasure. The Pacers look to have a bright future if they can roll out a healthy Oladipo, Sabonis, and Warren next season.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
      Closing thought: Basketball Reference not listing the nickname for T.J., which is “Tony Buckets,” on his player page is an atrocity. Pacer fans, rise up and demand change!
