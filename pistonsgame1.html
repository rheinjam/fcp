        The Detroit Pistons start to the 2020-2021 season went as expected. After a tumultuous offseason in which the Piston’s roster changed dramatically, most people agreed that it would be another long year for Pistons fans. While it’s important
        not to overreact to a single game, the Pistons play against the Timberwolves is not going to lead to much success.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Turnovers remain an issue. Kilian Hayes may be young and playing his first NBA games, but he made a few passes that you learn not to make when you first learn the sport. His turnovers, in particular, changed the outcome of this game. At one
        stretch in the fourth quarter, Hayes turned the ball over two times in a row leading to layups for the Timberwolves and a tied game. It also shifted the momentum in the Timberwolves and ultimately led to them prevailing in the game. While
        Hayes isn’t solely responsible for this loss and the turnover issues, he was a major contributor.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        On both sides of the Pistons are going to have a difficult time, especially when facing more talented squads. Karl-Anthony Towns missed some easy ones, but was close to finishing with a triple double. Other lesser Timberwolves players also
        shined, with several scoring in double digits. Offensively, the Pistons and their fanbase have to be concerned with the team’s three point shooting ability. They finished the day 5 for 28. In today’s NBA you can’t compete with this poor of
        shooting. When the Pistons go against some of the best teams in the league, it could get ugly quickly. While I don’t expect the Pistons to shoot this poorly night in and night out, the way the roster is constructed doesn’t lead to much
        optimism on the shooting front.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        There were a few bright spots, even in a game that was played as poorly as this one. Mason Plumlee received a generous contract this offseason and made the most of it. He finished with fourteen points, eight rebounds, and six assists. This
        type of performance is unsustainable and doesn’t take into account his miserable defense, but if Plumlee can do this now and again he might be worth the eight million dollars a year. Josh Jackson also showed up offensively, finishing the game
        with nineteen points. The Pistons need players like Plumlee and Jackson to continue to have big nights if the Pistons are going to try and compete in the East.

        The Pistons season continues against Cleveland on Saturday, December 26th.
