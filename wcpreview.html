        <u>NBA Playoff Preview- The Western Conference</u>
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        To say that it’s been a tumultuous season in the NBA would be a massive understatement. While COVID case numbers continue to increase across the United States, the NBA is preparing to resume play within its Walt Disney World bubble in
        Orlando, Florida- the belly of the pandemic beast. 22 of the league’s 30 teams will participate, with eight regular-season games serving as both a warm-up for the top seeded teams and a chance for teams just outside of the top 16 to make a
        run at a coveted playoff spot. The eighth seed is no longer a given, as a team within 4 games of that final spot could still sneak in the playoff by way of a play-in tournament.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        How to make sense of all this? Basketball’s comeback should serve a mental lifeline back to normalcy, but its return may only serve to highlight the alternate universe in which we all now seem to reside. Normally, just before the playoffs,
        we’d be talking about fluke injuries, mid-season trades that could improve a team’s title chances, and whether a young but talented team could withstand the pressure of a toxic playoff road environment.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        In a sport that usually favors its yearly top-seeded juggernauts due to its seven-game playoff format, this season’s playoffs are as difficult to predict as we can remember. Will players show up in shape? How long will it take to shake the
        rust? Could we see a freak accident on Epcot’s Test Track that injures a key playoff contributor? I’ll do my best to Imagineer some coherent thoughts below.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        We’re breaking the likely Western Conference playoff teams (sorry, San Antonio- only going 10 deep) into three categories:
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        1) Also-Rans: Playoff teams that do not have a realistic chance to reach the Finals.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        2) Favorites: Playoff teams with the best chance to reach the Finals in their respective conferences.

      <p class="article">
        3) Dark Horse Candidates: Playoff teams that could reach the Finals if things happen to fall their way.

      <p class="articleheading">
        <u>The Also-Rans</u>
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Oklahoma City Thunder
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Pre-Bubble Record: 40-24 (5th in Western Conference)
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Starters: Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Bench: Dennis Schroder, Terrance Ferguson, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazleyy, Hamidou Diallo, Mike Muscala, Andre Roberson, Abdel Nader

      <p class="articleheading">
        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Nerlens Noel (ankle-expected to play)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Thunder are the “wait, they’re in the top 5 in the conference?” team of the year. Well, the secret is out: Chris Paul is a bad man. Folks thought the Thunder were in for a tough year after Paul was shipped from Houston to a rebuilding
        Oklahoma City. Prior to this campaign, I figured that a 2020 Luguentz Dort was a decent entry-level merlot, not a starter on a playoff squad. Pleasant surprises aside, this team is very good on both ends but doesn’t do either offense or
        defense at an elite level (13th in offensive rating and 10th in defensive rating).
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Shooting, shooting, shooting. The Thunder shot 35.5% from three this season, good for only 18th in the NBA- can they pump that number up? If Andre Roberson cracks the playoff rotation, don’t expect that percentage to
        improve. Teams will pack the paint and dare them to shoot. 2) Much has been written about the Thunder’s deadly three-guard lineup of Paul, Shai, and backup guard Dennis Schroder. They can score, pass, dribble- but what about guard wing
        players with size? 3) OKC relies a lot on young, unproven wings: Dort, Ferguson, and I’d even put Shai in that category despite his stellar season. Can they be trusted to guard the monster wings in the West? Also, even if Roberson comes back,
        will his conditioning allow him to defend well enough to justify his inability to shoot the three?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> 1st round exit- Chris Paul has been an absolute wizard this season (not the Washington variety, thank goodness) and this roster has overachieved. However, this team’s best lineup has defensive limitations and the team just
        doesn’t have enough proven talent for me to project a win in the first round. They’re a team with great chemistry that just lacks the overall firepower.

        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Bojan Bogdanovic (out for season-right wrist surgery)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Yikes, how the season took a turn for the Utah Jazz. The Jazz were cruising along at fourth in the Western Conference looking like a team that could make a playoff series very difficult for any team in the league, even with Mike Conley
        struggling to adjust and having his worst season in recent memory. Suddenly… boom! COVID-19 hits. Gobert mocks the whole thing, then (probably/allegedly) infects star guard Donovan Mitchell with the virus. The two players are still trying to
        repair that relationship. As if that weren’t enough, starting forward and 20.2 ppg scorer Bojan Bogdanovic had season-ending wrist surgery in May. Does that sound like a team primed for a deep run?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Who fills the void left by Bogdanovic? While more playmaking opportunities for Conley could make him feel more comfortable, 20 points per game on 41% from three isn’t easy to replace. 2) Can Mitchell and Gobert fix
        their relationship? Your best player and your defensive anchor probably need to at least be able to speak with each other. Perhaps this could begrudgingly work out, like Pink Floyd when they recorded The Wall, but Utah’s already missing
        another starter. 3) Will coach Quin Snyder repeat as the winner of the “iciest playoff glare in the NBA” award? All signs point to yes. That man’s gaze is a sight to behold.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b>First-round exit. A perfect storm of circumstances has taken a real contender in the Western Conference and reduced it to a team that I don’t believe will play up to its current seeding. Utah plays a tough schedule of
        play-in games as well- this could be a team that could limp into the playoffs and see a swift exit.

        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Justise Winslow (hip injury- out for season)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Memphis has changed the face of its franchise quickly from the huge and experienced “grit and grind” teams to an uptempo squad with an exciting young core. Ja Morant continues to get better and better and could have a monster showing in Orlando. After a 13-22 start, Memphis drastically improved, going 19-11 over its next 30 games. However, this team as whole is only 20th in offensive rating and 16th in defensive rating and is low in the NBA rankings in free throw attempts per game, three-point shooting, and turnovers. It pains me to have to place one of the most talented and fun young teams in the NBA in the also-ran section, but the hill in the West is just too steep for this team to climb at this juncture.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can Jaren Jackson Jr. stay out of foul trouble? Foul trouble has always been an issue for Jackson Jr., even during his stint at Michigan State, which often forced Tom Izzo to send him to the bench early in the first halves of games. The talented young big man can shoot it from three, block shots, and move with the fluidity of a man half of his size but commits fouls at a staggering rate of 5.2 per 36 minutes. 2) Another shooting question- the Grizzlies are 25th in the league in attempted threes per game at 31.1 and only 21st in 3-point percentage at 35%.  Kyle Anderson, normally not a shooter, broke out with a 4-5 performance in Memphis’ first scrimmage. Can he and the rest of the team take a few more threes a game and hit at a high enough rate to improve their floor spacing? 3) Can this young team hang on to the ball in big games? Memphis is 23rd in the NBA in turnovers per game, not unusual for a young team that likes to push the ball and take risks in transition. With their lack of three-point shooting, they’ll need to be more careful with the ball to cement a playoff spot and challenge the Lakers.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First round or play-in exit. The Grizzlies remain in the driver’s seat for the 8 seed, but a suddenly healthy Portland team (discussed below) only has to stay within 4 games to force a play-in. While Memphis would only have to win one game to Portland’s two, Portland is more experienced, finally healthy, and will have the best player on the court in Damian Lillard. If Memphis holds the 8 seed, the Lakers are the likely opponent. This talented young team could make things interesting, but I just don’t see a team this young beating LeBron and Anthony Davis in 4 out of 7 games.

        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Austin Rivers (exited bubble-personal matter), Luc Mbah a Moute (undisclosed- arriving to bubble late).
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The 2019-2020 Rockets have been one of the most fascinating basketball experiments of all time. First, they traded Chris Paul for another ball-dominant point guard in Russell Westbrook, only this point guard can’t shoot (25.4% from three this season). Then, they traded standout big man Clint Capela for three-and-D wing Robert Covington. Bigs? They don’t need no stinking bigs! 6-foot-5 PJ Tucker moved to the center position, and Covington slotted in at the 4. So far, the results haven’t been all that bad. The Rockets are one game ahead of where they were a year ago with Chris Paul, though injuries to CP3 had a lot to do with that. It’s not clear whether Houston would have found a groove and rattled off a bunch of wins, or whether their up-and-down play leading up to the shutdown would have continued. An unprecedented team for an unprecedented time.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can Eric Gordon get his mojo back? Gordon underwent knee surgery early this season and just hasn’t been the same, struggling with his shooting just under 32% from three this year. Houston is built on efficiency from three from its non-Westbrook players, and cannot afford a hampered Gordon in the playoffs. The recent ankle injury does not improve Gordon’s chances here, as he is expected to miss six play-in games. 2) Will James Harden prove the doubters wrong? Perhaps unfairly, Harden’s playoff performances have been much maligned, despite the fact he was usually going cally incredible team in the Golden State Warriors in those losses. Harden will need to be fully engaged and at his best on both ends if Houston is to make a deep run. 3) Is small ball at its most extreme a viable way to win a championship? A Houston run to the Finals could result in a shift in the way the league drafts and values players. Sure, the Warriors went “small,” but not this small, as they had a near-seven-footer in Kevin Durant and an undersized big in Draymond Green that played far bigger than his physical size would indicate. The Rockets don’t have those types of “small” players and are at risk of getting abused by the murderer’s row of solid centers in the West.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First or second-round exit. This is a difficult team to project, as they are smack dab in the middle of the tight seeding in the West. If Houston draws the Jazz or Thunder in the first round, I like the Rockets in 6 games in either scenario.  Either way, Houston will be competitive in any series, but this franchise’s best chance to reach the Finals already passed with the unfortunate Chris Paul injury. If not earlier, Houston will meet their demise at the hands of one of the LA teams, though Houston will make them work hard for that victory.

      Bubble Losses/Injuries: Zion Williamson (left bubble for personal issue, has since returned-expected to play)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Another young team with loads of talent in the Western Conference, the talk in New Orleans has been all about superstar rookie Zion Williamson. Missing much of the early season with an injury and concerns about his conditioning, Zion made the then-pathetic Pelicans a completely different team once he made his debut. He’s freakishly athletic for his size and build and has an insanely quick jump that allows him to get off the floor twice in the same amount of time it takes another player to jump once, leading to plenty of offensive rebounds. Combine that with Lonzo Ball’s defense, passing, and improved jumper, Brandon Ingram’s steady scoring, and Jrue Holiday’s experience and lockdown defense, and this is an exciting young team. Pump the brakes a bit, though- the Pels were only 10-9 with Zion in the lineup.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can New Orleans take advantage of an “easy” play-in schedule? On paper, the Pels’ schedule looks easy, giving them a supposed advantage. However, that might not actually be the case, as lower-seeded teams in Orlando might take a more aggressive approach playing their best players more minut, as opposed to the top seeded teams taking it easy on their rotation guys. 2) Is Lonzo’s shooting this season the new normal, or a mirage? Lonzo has shot the three at 38% this season and looked better in general once Zion entered the lineup. Given that he shot it at just below 33% last season, this could be just an aberration. To sneak into the eighth seed, Lonzo’s hot shooting will need to continue. 3) Goodness gracious, can they stop giving the ball to the other team? New Orleans averages a staggering 16.2 turnovers per game, second to worst in the entire NBA. Zion is a good playmaker, but can still be a little out of control at times as a rookie. Even a below-average turnover margin would be an improvement for this team, which does not bode well for their chances at an 8 seed.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Misses playoffs. Like Memphis, this is another talented young team that just isn’t quite ready for the playoff spotlight yet. With a healthy Zion all season, they’d likely have one of those seeds locked in, but trailing both Portland and Memphis at this juncture will likely prove to be too much to overcome for Zion and company. General manager David Griffin has this franchise on the right track, and they’ll soon be in the discussion as one of the favorites in this conference.

      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Recently, it seems that Denver is usually the team that is always considered very good, but not the favorite to win the conference. This article continues that trend. Nikola Jokic is a monster at the center position with his passing, scoring, and rebounding. Denver is top-ten in offensive rating and is an above-average defensive team. However, Denver lacks a consistently elite perimeter player that can take over a playoff game that teams like the Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Mavericks, and Blazers all enjoy. Denver is a very good team, but barring injuries or other unforeseen circumstances, they’ll have a very difficult time coming out of the West when they’ll almost never have the best player in a series- certainly not the best perimeter player.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can Gary Harris return to his form from two seasons ago? Gary Harris has had a bit of a down year, shooting 33%. Two seasons ago, he was just a notch below 40%. He’s also been shooting the ball less as a whole. Denver will need an aggressive, confident Harris to go at the other elite wings in the West to make a deep run. 2) How will Jokic’s slim frame affect his play? Jokic arrived at the bubble showing off a slimmed-down body. If an out-of-shape Jokic can put up 20-10-7 on 52.8% shooting, imagine what an in-shape Joker can do! 3) Will Jamal Murray take the next step? As noted above, the reason this team is listed as an also-ran is the lack of a LeBron, Kawhi, Harden, or Lillard type of player. Pair one of those guys with Jokic and this is a Finals team. Murray averaged nearly 19 and 5 this season on 45.5% shooting and 34.5% from three. He’ll have to take his game to a new level and break in that top tier of NBA point guards if Denver is to reach the Finals, but at 27, it’s possible that he’s just about reached his peak already. 4) Will we see the all-big Denver lineup against the all-small Houston lineup? The world needs to see Jokic trying to cross up Westbrook at the top of the three-point line.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Second-round loss. Denver will be favored in just about any first-round matchup they draw, but the Mavericks and Rockets would be dangerous opponents that would both have the best player on the floor. I’d give the edge to the Nuggets in 7 games against Houston (who guards Jokic?) and would call the Mavericks series a 7-game toss-up, as it just seems like a ripe opportunity for a Luka Doncic coming-out party. This piece is not intended as a lob of disrespect at the Nuggets, but the NBA is a perimeter-oriented league these days and the Nuggets do not have the perimeter horses that many other teams in the West can utilize.

      <p class="article">
        The most discussed team of the season, and deservedly so. LeBron and AD on the same team alone warrant contender status, regardless of supporting cast- but that supporting cast is the question mark here, along with the general age of the team. Defensive wizard Avery Bradley has already backed out of playing in the bubble, with KCP expected to take his spot. Veteran point guard Rajon Rondo just had thumb surgery and is not expected to return until the second round. While this hurts the depth of the Lakers, it may not be reason to panic. LA went 17-3 with KCP in the starting lineup this season.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can L.A. get efficient three-point shooting from its role players? Kuzma and Morris stand out as question marks. It’s not clear what Waiters and Smith have left in the tank at this point despite promising performances in scrimmage play thus far. However, KCP has had his best three-point shooting season to date this year. LA will need that to continue to reach the finals. 2) Will Anthony Davis be willing to move to the 5-spot for significant stretches? It’s not a lineup that L.A. has featured a ton this year due to strong play from McGee and Howard, but the LeBron/AD pick and roll with three shooters could be devastating in crunch time. 3) With Rondo out for 6-8 weeks, can LA survive without a battle-tested second ball handler and playmaker? LeBron picking up too much of the playmaking slack too early could hinder him in later rounds. Quinn Cook will need to make the most of the newfound minutes. While these players are rested, they’ll be playing a lot in a short period of time.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> NBA Finals. The age of the team and depth issues aside, it’s difficult to bet against LeBron James when he’ll also have the second-best player in almost any given series on his team- particularly after months of rest. This may not be the most creative of takes, but I’m riding with the team that has two of the league’s five best players, as well as its most powerful bald spot since ‘Sheed.

        The other favorite in the Western Conference, the Clippers present a rare combination of star power and depth. Lead by reigning finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and perennial all-star Paul George, the Clips also boast a bench that’s full of dudes that can straight up play: “Sweet” Lou Williams, a scoring machine who is as comfortable closing games as he is eating lemon pepper wings, Montrezl Harrel, a grinding, energetic, athletic big, among others. Even former defensive player of the year Joakim Noah has found his way on the roster, starting in their first exhibition game. There’s a lot to like here. Why did I pick the Lakers again?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Paul George boasts a career playoff three-point percentage of 36% and shot an ice-cold 31.9% from three in the postseason for the Thunder last season. His overall FG% also took a hit in last year’s playoffs. The spacing in LA is much better than it was in OKC, but can PG13 carry his regular season form over to the postseason? He’ll need to do so to get to the Finals. 2) Can the Clippers get their momentum back with a break in roster continuity? Shamet, Beverly, Williams, and Harrell are all missing/have missed time away from the team. 3) What happens if twin brothers Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris guard each other in a Clipper-Laker series? Will the simulation break? I’ll be watching closely.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Conference Finals- Even in the bizarre Orlando bubble, I don’t see a team knocking the Clippers out early. As ESPN writer Zach Lowe pointed out in early March, they do just about everything well, and teams that can play multiple styles tend to succeed in the playoffs. Researching for this article, I almost changed my Finals pick from the Lakers to the Clippers, but growing up a Piston fan circa-2006, I am well aware of how LeBron James can will a team with less depth, less talent, and worse coaching to a Finals (Boobie Gibson still appears in my nightmares). Otherwise, this is the team with the least amount of question marks in the conference and appears to be on a collision course with the Lakers for an all-LA conference finals.

        Mark Cuban’s team can flat-out score. They’re not just scoring the most in the NBA this season, they have a chance to be the most efficient offensive team in NBA history, sporting a league-best offensive rating of 115.8. Luka Doncic has been nothing short of incredible at the ripe age of 21 and unicorn big man Kristaps Porzingis started to look as healthy as he’s been since his Knicks days before the shutdown. Teams will be throwing the kitchen sink at the young Doncic to try and slow this offense down. Luka’s been playing professional ball since he was a teenager though, and Coach Rick Carlisle will ensure that Luka is in good positions on the floor to avoid those traps and doubles.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Yes, the Mavericks can score, but can they stop anyone? They’re 15th in the league in points allowed and 17th in defensive rating. Games tend to slow down and get more physical in the playoffs, and it’s not clear whether Dallas will be able to get enough key stops to close out tight games when buckets are tougher to come by. 2) Can Dallas overcome the loss of depth? Not only is Powell out, but the man signed to replace him opted out of the bubble. Dallas is also missing veteran wing Courtney Lee and backup PG Jalen Brunson, replaced by Michael-Kidd Gilchrist and Trey Burke. It remains to be seen whether MKG and Burke will make much of a difference come playoff time. 3)  Boban Watch: Will the lack of depth at the 5 open up minutes for Boban? While he struggles to defend the pick and roll, he is money in the low post and converts free throws at a high rate. He’s a great option to ignite an offense if perimeter shooting slows down.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Second round exit. The Mavs are currently in the 7 seed, but moving up a spot or two isn’t completely out of the question. With Kawhi and Paul George on the wing, the Clippers are not a great matchup for the Mavs, as the Mavs are not great defensively on the wing. If the Mavs avoid the Clippers early though, the Mavs have enough firepower to beat anyone this postseason. Also, my heart simply won’t allow me to put Boban in the also-ran section. Come back to Detroit, Boban. We miss you.

        Really? A 29-37 team 3.5 games behind the Grizzlies for the 8 seed is a dark horse, you say? Absolutely- for a couple of unprecedented reasons. First, if the 9th place team is within 4 games of the 8th place team, that triggers a play-in tournament for that 8th seed. Second, the Blazer team in Orlando will be a much different team than the M*A*S*H* unit we saw during the regular season. Guards Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum lead Portland to 53 wins last season and the 3rd seed in the Western Conference that year. A healthy Blazer team this season would not be well below .500. With a chance to put the NBA back on notice, I’m betting on Portland to make some noise in Orlando.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) What does the playoff rotation look like? That question revolves around Whiteside’s health. Whiteside could start at the 5 with Nurkic at the 4, moving Collins to the bench. Coach Terry Stots has indicated that he wants to play Nurkic and Whiteside together. 2) Can Portland overcome the loss of Ariza’s experience and defense? Ariza was an ideal glue guy for this Blazer team, scoring 11 ppg and shooting an excellent 40% from 3, and has filled that role on a title team before. He’s also provided a good defensive presence. Carmelo Anthony is expected to start at the 3 now and is not known to be a defensive stopper at this point in his career. Blazer fans have hope though, as Melo appeared in the bubble noticeably thinner, leading the internet to dub him “Skinny Melo.” The Blazers will need Skinny to D up as they enter the thick of the play-in schedule. 3)  Will Nurkic and Lillard pick up where they left off? Nurkic was quietly one of the NBA’s best bigs last season before suffering a devastating leg injury in March of 2019. He’s a great pick and roll partner for Lillard and a guy that really makes this Blazer team hum when he is on the floor. Portland will need that chemistry to be there right away to make a run.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First round exit. Ok, I’m cheating a little bit here. I still think the Lakers beat this team in 6 or 7 games- but this team has the backcourt firepower, swagger, and beef at the 4 and 5 to pull off an upset. In my opinion, the Blazers are the best equipped team outside of the Clippers to take the Lakers down before the NBA finals. It’s a pick that’s very popular on the internet nowadays, but I like the Blazers to take the 8 seed and even do more if the cards fall their way. Without Rondo and Avery Bradley available, who on the Lakers can guard Portland’s dynamic backcourt?
