      <u>NBA Playoff Preview- The Western Conference</u>
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        To say that it’s been a tumultuous season in the NBA would be a massive understatement. While COVID case numbers continue to increase across the United States, the NBA is preparing to resume play within its Walt Disney World bubble in Orlando, Florida- the belly of the pandemic beast. 22 of the league’s 30 teams will participate, with eight regular-season games serving as both a warm-up for the top seeded teams and a chance for teams just outside of the top 16 to make a run at a coveted playoff spot. The eighth seed is no longer a given, as a team within 4 games of that final spot could still sneak in the playoff by way of a play-in tournament.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        How to make sense of all this? Basketball’s comeback should serve a mental lifeline back to normalcy, but its return may only serve to highlight the alternate universe in which we all now seem to reside. Normally, just before the playoffs, we’d be talking about fluke injuries, mid-season trades that could improve a team’s title chances, and whether a young but talented team could withstand the pressure of a toxic playoff road environment.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        In a sport that usually favors its yearly top-seeded juggernauts due to its seven-game playoff format, this season’s playoffs are as difficult to predict as we can remember. Will players show up in shape? How long will it take to shake the rust? Could we see a freak accident on Epcot’s Test Track that injures a key playoff contributor? I’ll do my best to Imagineer some coherent thoughts below.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        We’re breaking the likely Western Conference playoff teams (sorry, San Antonio- only going 10 deep) into three categories:
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        1) Also-Rans: Playoff teams that do not have a realistic chance to reach the Finals.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        2) Favorites: Playoff teams with the best chance to reach the Finals in their respective conferences.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        3) Dark Horse Candidates: Playoff teams that could reach the Finals if things happen to fall their way.
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
      <u>The Also-Rans</u>
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Oklahoma City Thunder
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Pre-Bubble Record: 40-24 (5th in Western Conference)
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Starters: Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Danilo Gallinari, Steven Adams
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Bench: Dennis Schroder, Terrance Ferguson, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazleyy, Hamidou Diallo, Mike Muscala, Andre Roberson, Abdel Nader
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Nerlens Noel (ankle-expected to play)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Thunder are the “wait, they’re in the top 5 in the conference?” team of the year. Well, the secret is out: Chris Paul is a bad man. Folks thought the Thunder were in for a tough year after Paul was shipped from Houston to a rebuilding Oklahoma City. Prior to this campaign, I figured that a 2020 Luguentz Dort was a decent entry-level merlot, not a starter on a playoff squad. Pleasant surprises aside, this team is very good on both ends but doesn’t do either offense or defense at an elite level (13th in offensive rating and 10th in defensive rating).
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Shooting, shooting, shooting. The Thunder shot 35.5% from three this season, good for only 18th in the NBA- can they pump that number up? If Andre Roberson cracks the playoff rotation, don’t expect that percentage to improve. Teams will pack the paint and dare them to shoot. 2) Much has been written about the Thunder’s deadly three-guard lineup of Paul, Shai, and backup guard Dennis Schroder. They can score, pass, dribble- but what about guard wing players with size? 3) OKC relies a lot on young, unproven wings: Dort, Ferguson, and I’d even put Shai in that category despite his stellar season. Can they be trusted to guard the monster wings in the West? Also, even if Roberson comes back, will his conditioning allow him to defend well enough to justify his inability to shoot the three?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> 1st round exit- Chris Paul has been an absolute wizard this season (not the Washington variety, thank goodness) and this roster has overachieved. However, this team’s best lineup has defensive limitations and the team just doesn’t have enough proven talent for me to project a win in the first round. They’re a team with great chemistry that just lacks the overall firepower.
