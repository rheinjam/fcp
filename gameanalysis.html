      Today was a full docket of N.B.A. action starting with Toronto and Miami. I was excited about this one, coming off having watched Toronto dismantle the Lakers two days prior. I hadn’t seen Miami play in the bubble until today, and liked what I saw from them. People were worried that competitiveness was going to be an issue going into the bubble, but games liket this prove those concerns weren’t valid. In the first few minutes of the game, Jimmy Butler blocked Lowry and then gave him the Mutombo finger wag. His hyper competitiveness kept them in the game and it did come down to the last few minutes, but again the Raptors prevailed. On a side note, I love the Duncan Robinson story and I’m rooting for him to play much better than he did today (1-5 from the field).

      Speaking of competitiveness, the Raptors Heat game was followed by a game that matched it’s intensity. OKC and Denver went back and forth all game and both teams were playing at a high level. The beginning of the fourth quarter belonged to Michael Porter Jr. who sank several three pointers. As the game neared its end there were several fouls and resulting free throws, but ultimately the game went into overtime. From there Jokic took over and Denver dominated the overtime period.

      Pelicans and Grizzlies was the one matchup most people had their eyes on. The Pelicans were coming off one of the first defeats in the history of their franchise, and the Grizzlies were fresh off a loss as well. Zion and Ingram started the game by going to the rim with reckless abandon. I thought for sure that someone was going to get injured, but somehow everyone escaped unscathed. It was another close game for a day full of them. Towards the end of the game Ingram had big basket after big basket, and Zion finally played at the end of a game. Though he appeared winded again, this time he was able to contribute in the way we are used to seeing from him. The outcome of this game has changed the West playoff race, which will make it more entertaining in the coming weeks. Now Portland and San Antonio are well within striking distance to Memphis, and New Orleans has potentially saved their season.
