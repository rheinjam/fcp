        <u>NBA Round 1 Playoff Preview- The Western Conference</u>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="article">
        What a treat this bubble has been for NBA fans! We’ve seen beef between star players escalate into barbs exchanged by player family members, questionable playing time decisions, a new NBA star born, an improbable undefeated bubble run ending in disappointment, and yet another Boban block on Dwight Howard. Now that the seeding games are out of the way, it’s time to get down to business. Below are some short blurbs on each Western Conference series, and my predictions.
      </p>


      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="articleheading">
        (1) Los Angeles Lakers v (8) Portland Trail Blazers
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Portland has essentially been playing in an extended playoff series since it arrived in the bubble, lead by bubble MVP Damian Lillard. Lillard has put up insane scoring numbers and carried this team on his back, aided by some clutch buckets from CJ McCollum, who continues to play through a back injury. It seems like every game Portland has played in has been close regardless of the quality of the opponent, likely due to their low defensive rating (28th in the NBA). Portland’s offensive output has been staggering all year at 3rd-best in the NBA and they look even better on that end with Nurkic and Collins back in the fold. Portland’s ability to win close games has been encouraging, but it’s also concerning that they haven’t been able to hold big leads or slam the door on lesser teams.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Los Angeles’ bubble performance is difficult to quantify, as the Lakers pretty much had the 1 seed locked up and mostly used the seeding games as scrimmages to get back in shape. LeBron has been uncharacteristically mortal in the bubble so far, shooting well under 50% from the field. Starter Danny Green has shot only 22.7% from three in the month of August so far and the Lakers have struggled with their perimeter shooting in the bubble. The Lakers remain a great defensive team though and Portland’s poor perimeter defense should allow LA’s perimeter shooting to get back on track. Also, who guards LeBron for Portland? Slim Melo? Mario Hezonja? Gary Trent Jr.? Not an ideal situation.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Prediction:</b>Lakers in six. Portland has an advantage early in the series in that they won’t have to shake any rust. Lillard, McCollum and the gang score enough points to be able to extend the series out to six, but Portland just doesn’t have the defense necessary to limit James and Davis once they get going. I like Portland to steal an early series lead, but for Los Angeles to roll once they get back in gear and figure things out.

          (2) Los Angeles Clippers vs (7) Dallas Mavericks
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          The Clippers’ theme of never having their full roster on hand continued in the bubble this season. Lou Williams was forced into quarantine following his wing expedition, Montrezl Harrell left the bubble due to a death in the family and remains in quarantine, Landry Shamet is day-to-day with a foot injury, and Patrick Beverly left the bubble for a personal issue. Despite this fact, the Clippers played well in the bubble, and still feature two of the premier wing players in the league in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. If any roster in the NBA can handle a break in continuity, this is probably it. The Clipper bench would make for a competitive regular season team. What else is there to say about the Clippers that hasn’t already been said? On paper, they’re a team devoid of major weaknesses with depth at every position. My only concern is how quickly these players can all get on the same page against a unit that’s had more continuity over the past few weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          Dallas continued its trend of putting up major points in the bubble but not playing much defense, giving up a league-worst 126.9 points per game in that span. Dallas gave up 116.7 points per game in their matchups against LA this season, all three of those resulting in losses.  With a 3-5 bubble record (including a final game where they rested their key guys), Luka continued his brilliance, making the all-bubble first team, and Kristaps Porzingis continues to look healthy, knocking down outside shots and converting dunks off the pick and roll. This Dallas team has had trouble winning close games all season, which could doom them against a deep team that has several willing and experienced players capable of closing games.
        <p class="article">
          <b>Prediction:</b>Clippers in five. Mavs fans did not want to see Los Angeles in the first round. The Clippers present a matchup nightmare for the Mavericks with their two huge and athletic wing players they can throw at Luka Doncic in Leonard and George. Dallas does not have plus defenders at the wing positions and those two should be able to get comfortable shots at will. While Luka and Kristaps are incredible talents, both will be experiencing their first playoff series and have not shown the ability to close out close games. Dallas is talented enough to shoot its way to a win early in the series, but I expect Los Angeles to dominate the series with its depth, defense, experience, and balanced scoring.

            (3) Denver Nuggets vs (6) Utah Jazz
          </p>
          <p class="article">
            Utah entered the bubble already missing a starter. Bojan Bogdanovic, a 20 ppg scorer and elite three-point shooter, underwent wrist surgery earlier in the year that ended his season. The Jazz just received more bad news, as point guard Mike Conley is leaving the bubble for the birth of his son. With the quarantine procedures in place, Conley will miss at least a couple of games, though that timetable is not clear at this point. The Jazz still boast explosive scorer Donovan Mitchell and elite rim protector and season-canceller Rudy Gobert (who has given Nikola Jokic problems in the past). Who steps up to initiate the offense in Conley’s absence? The Jazz just lost to Denver in overtime on August 8th and that was with Conley available and scoring 22 points. While Conley has not played up to his usual standard this season, losing him for a few games could prove fatal to the Jazz.
          </p>
          <p class="article">
            Denver is also dealing with some injury issues, as both Gary Harris and Will Barton have not played in the bubble. The absence of these players resulted in a nice surprise for Denver in the form of Michael Porter Jr., who averaged over 19 ppg in the bubble in an expanded role, making the all-bubble second team. Nikola Jokic is the motor that makes this team go, as he put up 30 points, 11 boards, and 7 assists against the Jazz in their bubble meeting earlier this month. Denver will need Porter to continue to produce at a high level, especially if Harris and Barton remain unavailable. Utah’s best shot will come if Porter struggles in his first playoff appearance and Harris and Barton remained sidelined. Coach Mike Malone should resist the urge to pull Porter if he makes a mistake or two on defense. Porter’s scoring is simply too important in this series. Just look at Portland! They don’t play any defense and that seems to be working for them!
          <p class="article">
            <b>Prediction:</b>Nuggets in six. Both of these teams are dealing with missing players, but Utah’s missing pieces are more essential. Conley and Bogdanovic were both initiators of offense, while Denver relies on Jokic and Jamal Murray (both healthy) to create shots for others. Also, Denver is simply the better team from top to bottom and has a legitimate top-5 MVP candidate in Jokic. Utah remains feisty, disciplined, and well-coached, but does not have the talent and scoring punch to win this series, especially with Conley missing the first couple of games. If Harris and Barton remain unavailable, I still like Denver in six. If one or both play and are healthy, give me Denver in five.

              (4) Houston Rockets vs (5) Oklahoma City Thunder
            </p>
            <p class="article">
            This series could shape up to be the most compelling in the first round for a variety of reasons. Rocket superstar Russell Westbrook suffered a strained right quadriceps muscle and will miss the first several games of the playoffs at least. James Harden should continue his historic offensive output, but suddenly Houston is forced to look for a second fiddle to score and make plays for others. The two best candidates appear to be Austin Rivers, a useful player but not one you want carrying a huge load, and a potentially hobbled Eric Gordon, who is only shooting 31% from three this season and coming off of an injury. Overall, this series presents an opportunity for James Harden to silence the doubters and dominate a series from beginning to end, but can he mentally and physically pull this off?
            </p>
            <p class="article">
              Thunder point guard Chris Paul has plenty of motivation heading into this series, as Houston traded him to Oklahoma City for Russell Westbrook about a year ago. Many fans thought OKC was destined to miss the playoffs and that OKC would move on from CP3 following the season. While OKC could still trade Paul, he has lead the Thunder to an impressive year and has helped the young talent develop, particularly Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Thunder have been excellent in close games all season, a remarkable accomplishment considering the youth of the roster. In my mind, OKC is a steady team that has a lower ceiling than Houston but a much higher floor given the circumstances. Can Thunder center Steven Adams dominate the offensive glass and punish Houston for playing a tiny lineup? OKC has not rebounded the ball well on the offensive end and will need to squeeze everything it can out of its size advantage.
            <p class="article">
              <b>Prediction:</b>Thunder in seven. James Harden is more than capable of carrying the load for the Rockets for a game or two, but can he do it for an entire playoff series? OKC will not beat themselves- they don’t turn the ball over, generally win close games, and have the most seasoned and capable assist man in the league outside of LeBron James. The good news for Houston is that this series does not come after a full regular season load, but these players have had to play a lot of basketball in a short amount of time. Normally in the NBA, I tend to side with the team that will have the best player in the series, which is Houston in this instance- but given the question marks surrounding Gordon’s health, the small-ball experiment, and the thin margin for error for Harden in these games, OKC is just the safer pick in what will be a battle of a series.
