        As is tradition, the defending champs remain in the top spot to start the season (barring significant roster turnover or injury). Both Lebron James and Anthony Davis signed extensions with the Lakers, who saw departures of some rotation guys
        (Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, Avery Bradley, Danny Green), but acquired a couple of sixth man of the year candidates (Montrezl Harrell, Dennis Schröder) and a pair of solid, seasoned veterans (Marc Gasol, Wesley Matthews).
        Overall, this roster seems more balanced than last season’s unit.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Doubters might point to the defensive slippage LA could experience with the loss of their solid big-man tandem from last season and two excellent defensive guards in Rondo and Bradley, claim that LA benefitted from gap in play pre-bubble and
        would otherwise have worn down, or point to LeBron’s age. I’ll hear none of it. Two of the top five players in the league both happen to play for the same team. One is at worst top five all-time (probably top two) and the other is quickly
        ascending the list. No other team in the league boasts two legitimate superstars that were both healthy the season prior. The Lake Show are in a class of their own- not just in the West, but in the NBA as a whole.

        Shocking that the team boasting noted extrovert Kawhi Leonard as its best player has become the biggest soap opera in the league over the past several months, but here we are. After coach Doc Rivers moved on to Philadelphia, Paul George
        hopped on the All the Smoke podcast to attack Rivers for decreasing George’s pick and roll and post-up usage last season… only, the stats don’t exactly back up PG13’s complaints. The Clippers rewarded George’s behavior with a $190 million
        contract extension.
        On top of all that, super sub Montrezl Harrell bailed on the Clippers for the rival Lakers.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        NBA Twitter and its legion of memes might have you thinking that this Clipper team will crumble, but it’s not all doom and gloom for LA. Experienced stretch big Serge Ibaka should provide some defensive versatility the Clippers lacked last
        year, and Piston legend Luke Kennard continues to show promise not only with his shooting, but with his playmaking ability. Additionally, last year’s Clipper team was plagued with injuries and absences, never allowing the team to establish
        clearly defined roles or get in a great rhythm. More continuity this year could result in the Clippers finishing with the best record in the league- the ceiling is really that high. With all that being said, new head coach Tyronn Lue has a
        daunting task ahead of him trying to get this team to gel enough to meet its lofty expectations.

      <p class="article">
        It was a great year for the Denver Nuggets, who shocked the NBA world by upsetting the Clippers in the second round. To Denver fans, however, this may not have been much of a surprise. Nikola Jokic is a basketball genius and likely the
        greatest passing big man of all time (apologies to Arvydas Sabonis and Bill Walton) but can also bully people down low and stroke long jumpers. Point guard Jamal Murray took the next step Denver fans had been hoping for, dropping a 40-piece
        on the Clippers in game seven to set up a series against the Lakers in the conference finals. These guys gave some of the league’s elite the business, and the star pair are only 25 and 23 years old, respectively.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        But what about this season? Denver could take a bit of a step back defensively, as lockdown defender Jerami Grant opted to leave for Detroit, pursuing a bigger offensive role and one of the league’s most famous t-shirt cannons. Likely to take
        a big chunk of Grant’s minutes is talented young forward Michael Porter Jr., who made the All-Bubble Second Team at the end of last season. Porter has a sweet stroke and is a very athletic 6-foot-10, but struggles defensively. His defensive
        win shares from last season were 1.1, tied for 203rd best in the NBA. Denver’s ceiling likely depends on Porter’s development. Also worth watching are Gary Harris’ three-point percentage and Will Barton’s health. Overall, this is a fun team
        that showed resilience in the playoffs last year. If the bounces all go Denver’s way, this team could conceivably sneak into the Finals.

      <!-- Dallas Mavericks -->
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="articleheading">
        4. Dallas Mavericks
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Last season: 43-32, seventh in Western Conference, lost in first round
      </p>
      <p class="article">

        I’m admittedly a little nervous putting Dallas this high, but it seems like we’re witnessing what could be the beginning of the emergence of the next great NBA superstar. Luka Doncic is already doing all-time-great NBA stuff, and he’s still
        scratching the surface of what he could become. Dallas was the most efficient offense in the NBA last year by a decent margin. They lost sharpshooter Seth Curry but gained 3-and-D wing Josh Richardson, which should improve their lackluster
        defensive numbers somewhat.

      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Yeah, there are major concerns regarding the health of Kristaps Porzingis. It seems as though Dallas is targeting January 1st for his return (which wouldn’t be bad), but if he misses significant time returning from meniscus surgery, Dallas will be in the middle of the brawl at the bottom of the playoffs fighting for that eighth seed or play-in game. An interesting stat here from NBA.com- Dallas was 8-19 in games that were within 3 points in the final minute of play. That is a bizarrely low win rate in such situations, and I think it speaks to a mixture of bad luck and relative youth rather than an indictment of Luka’s clutch ability. The numbers in those close games should improve, and Dallas’ playoff seeding along with it.

      </p>


      <!-- Portland-->
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="articleheading">
        5. Portland Trail Blazers
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
      Last season: 35-39, eighth in Western Conference, lost in first round
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Don’t let Portland’s mediocre record from last season fool you- this is a completely different team this season. Portland struggled with injuries during last year’s regular season, losing starting big men Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins to injury as well as defensive wings Rodney Hood and Trevor Ariza (Ariza opted out of bubble play). With most of its frontcourt missing, Portland limped to a 35-39 regular season record and was 28th in the NBA in defensive rating. Despite these shortcomings (and having to play Mario Hezonja meaningful minutes last season), Portland managed to win its play-in game before LeBron and the Lakers feasted on Portland’s depleted perimeter defense, winning the series 3-1.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      This year, Portland returns its key pieces and made some important improvements. Of course, Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum are back, both players capable of creating their own shot and going off for 30 or more any given night. Carmelo Anthony returns, this year accepting a bench role- while not a stalwart defensively, he can get you a tough bucket down the stretch of a playoff game. Perhaps most importantly of all, Portland upgraded its wing situation, bringing in Robert Covington Jr., and will see Rodney Hood return from injury. Portland is a great offensive team that was crippled defensively last season. If they’re even average on defense this year, which I think they will be given a healthy frontcourt and the addition of Covington, they are a solid playoff team in the West.

      <!-- Utah -->

        6. Utah Jazz
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Last season: 44-28, sixth in Western Conference, lost in first round
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Hey everyone- Utah is still good. They’re pretty much the same team from last season, and they don’t really have a major question mark. The Jazz boast an all-star scorer in Donovan Mitchell, the Stifle Tower, cagey veteran Joe Ingles, and they get Bojan Bogdanovic back, who missed the entire bubble due to injury. Despite Bojan’s absence, Utah pushed the Denver Nuggets to a game seven, lead by Mitchell’s scorching-hot 36.3 points per game on 52.9% shooting overall and 51.6% shooting from three. Spida took a major leap from the regular season to the playoffs last year.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      With all of these positives and an improving young star, why isn’t Utah higher? Well, the very best teams in the West have two dominant scorers, not just one, and have at least one bonafide superstar. The Lakers boast LeBron and AD, the Clippers Kawhi and Paul George, Denver has a superstar big in Jokic with the all-star level Murray to flank him, and Portland has an established superstar in Damian Lillard paired with CJ McCollum (not yet an all-star but a scorer of that caliber). Mitchell’s performance in last year’s playoffs was superstar level, but it’s not clear whether that level of hot shooting is sustainable for him long-term. Rudy Gobert is an all-star defensive big, but is not known for his scoring. Until a second offensive option at the level of the top four teams emerges, Utah simply lacks the firepower to be categorized with the Western Conference elite.

      <p class="articleheading">
        Last season: 34-39, tenth in Western Conference, missed playoffs
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Another team that could experience a meteoric rise, the Suns made a splash and acquired perennial all-star and recent journeyman Chris Paul, who led the Thunder to a surprisingly successful season last year. Paul joins young scoring dynamo Devin Booker and improving big man Deandre Ayton to form a solid nucleus. Throw in seasoned wing Jae Crowder, and this is suddenly a team with  multiple veterans in its rotation. Even without a point guard of Paul’s caliber, Phoenix showed great potential at the end of last season, going undefeated in the bubble and nearly creeping in a play-in series. Chris Paul was able to lead a supporting cast of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Dennis Schröder, and Steven Adams to the fifth seed in the West last year, and this Suns roster is likely more talented.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      There are some reasons to doubt Phoenix: the loss of Aron Baynes, the age and injury history of Paul, and the team’s penchant for fouling and turning the ball over. Otherwise, I might have put them as high as the sixth spot. A healthy CP3 covers up a lot of the usual mistakes a young team makes offensively and takes some playmaking responsibilities out of Devin Booker’s hands, which could make him even more efficient this season. At long last, Phoenix fans… the seats will be clean, the parking lot full, and the nacho cheese warm and covered in real jalapeños.

Back-to-back seasons of losing the toaster-signing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyGcGV72ac" target="_blank">scaffolding-avoiding sharpshooter</a> have thrown a wrench in the plans of Steve Kerr and company’s quest to return to the Finals. Without Thompson, two-time league MVP Stephen Curry’s usage this season should skyrocket. Curry could have another record-breaking season, but what about the other dudes? This team will lean heavily on relatively unproven players: lottery pick James Wiseman will likely be expected to play big minutes this year, Kelly Oubre Jr. will attempt to replicate some of the shooting Thompson normally provides, and Andrew Wiggins will be asked to tap into his physical potential on the defensive end while making enough jump shots to keep defenses honest.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      There are a lot of question marks here. Curry cannot miss significant time this season if GSW hopes to make the playoffs. Draymond will have to be the Draymond of old. Finally, some of the young guys that took major lumps last year will have to step up to give Golden State the depth necessary to win on a consistent basis. Plenty of scenarios exist that result in GSW missing the playoffs, but I just don’t see Curry, Green, and Kerr missing the postseason for the second year in a row barring a significant injury. Call this a “respect pick.”

      How does one go about ranking this team as of mid-December 2020? At the time of this writing, the Rockets have traded Russell Westbrook to the Wizards for John Wall and a pick. James Harden just returned from partying in Vegas as trade rumors continue to swirl. It seems clear that Harden is not interested in playing in Houston this season. Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Miami, and Milwaukee have appeared in rumors as potential suitors. However, even if Harden stays, this year presents additional uncertainty and risk. John Wall hasn’t played more than 50 games since calendar year 2017 (thank you to the Bill Simmons Podcast for beating that stat into my head) and new addition Demarcus Cousins has also had significant injury problems over the years. Also, it is not clear whether Christian Wood’s dominant stretch of play last season was just a hot streak or something that Wood will be able to maintain consistently.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        This team has a top-four ceiling if everything goes according to plan and Harden suddenly has a change of heart, but I see the departures of Morey and D’Antoni as the beginning of the end of Houston’s recent run of success. In the event Houston refuses to trade Harden, will he be willing to fully invest on both ends this season? Will Twitter continue to body shame him? There are simply too many good teams in the West this year to justify a playoff spot for Houston right now given the number of questions the team currently faces.

      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Grizz are yet another promising young Western Conference team bursting at the seams with talent. Led by superstar-in-the-making Ja Morant and lengthy stretch big Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis appears to be building a force in the West for years to come.  Last season, Memphis was top ten in field goal percentage, assists per game, and rebounds per game despite the youth of its roster. However, youth does come with growing pains, as the Grizz turned the ball over and fouled opposing teams more than the average squad. They also struggled to shoot the ball from deep, ranking 23rd in the NBA in that category.

      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Memphis will have to deal with injuries to a couple of key players to start the season, as Jackson Jr. continues to recover from a torn meniscus and Justise Winslow a hip injury. With how close the seeding in the 7-12 range in the West could be this season, Memphis cannot afford to have players miss extended time. Also, it remains to be seen whether this team has enough perimeter scoring punch outside of Morant and Jackson to secure a playoff spot in the West. I love the young core of this team (shoutout Xavier Tillman) but I think we’ll see a slight regression in seeding this season with some rotation guys missing time early and the rest of the league adjusting to Ja Morant. With a little more time and some additional shooting on the roster, this franchise will soon be poised to compete for a high seed in the West.

      New Orleans was a trendy pick to sneak into the play-in during the bubble, but only posted a 2-6 record in Orlando, prompting the Pels to make some changes. Stan Van Gundy is now the head coach, and management traded Jrue Holiday and received Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, and a couple of first round picks in return as part of four-team deal. With Stan at the helm, this team will likely improve upon its mediocre defense from last season (21st in defensive rating). The question is whether this team will figure out a way to make its talented pieces fit together on the offensive end, particularly an explosive, young Blue Devil.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Zion Williamson is one of the most exciting young stars the league has ever seen, but how the heck do you get the most out of him? Do you keep him at the four next to a traditional 5 like Adams, run him as a small-ball 5, or even try him out at the three, running the wing opposite Brandon Ingram? Will Zion be healthy and in shape? Putting Zion issues aside, will Lonzo Ball continue to improve his jump shot? How much will the team’s perimeter defense suffer without Jrue Holiday? Like Memphis, this is another team with an impressive young core that is still in the process of figuring things out and is likely another year or two away from a playoff spot in the West.

      After decades of continued excellence, Gregg Popovich’s team is finally entering the thick of its rebuilding phase. It was flat-out bizarre to see a Spurs team that was below average defensively, as the Spurs were only 25th in defensive rating last season per Basketball-Reference. Combine that with the fact that two primary offensive weapons on the team didn’t shoot threes (DeRozan, Aldridge), and it’s going to be tough to win games consistently when other teams come down and get three points compared to your two. There are opportunities for change here – the Spurs were fourth in the league in three-point percentage last season, but were only twenty-eighth in attempts. Let it fly, Coach Pop!
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      If San Antonio successfully changes its style and perhaps even converts LaMarcus Aldridge to a more of a stretch big, the Spurs could outperform expectations. But what would outperforming expectations even look like? It doesn’t seem as though the ceiling of this roster is one that could reach the top 8 of the teams in this conference barring catastrophic injuries to multiple teams. Additionally, two of the guys that spearheaded the Spurs’ high three-point percentage, Marco Belinelli and Bryn Forbes, are no longer on the team. You have to shoot the three well and defend it well to win in the modern NBA, and despite Coach Pop’s greatness, it is difficult to see the roster providing the offensive oomph necessary to reach the playoffs in a stacked West.

Edwards personally caught a rainbow trout with his bare hands and slapped Tom Izzo’s Spartans with it repeatedly at the Maui Invitational last season, so we know the kid can get hot- but can he shoot it from distance well enough to be a modern NBA star? Edwards posted a meager 29.4 three-point percentage at Georgia last season. If that continues, this team’s 28th-best three-point shooting from last season is not likely to improve.

        Still, the duo of Karl Anthony-Towns and De’Angelo Russell along with young talent like Edwards and    Culver should demonstrate some improvement from last season. Remember- KAT missed significant time last year due to various ailments and a short suspension. Some continuity and positive momentum for this franchise should at least give them a chance to make the play-in if players like Edwards and Culver perform at a high level. Towns overcoming incredible adversity and having a huge year could be one of the best storylines of this upcoming season and I am pulling for him to set the league on fire in the 2020-21 campaign.

        14. Sacramento Kings

         Last season: 31-41, twelfth in Western Conference, missed playoffs

      Last season, the Kings fouled a lot, didn’t rebound well, didn’t get to the free throw line, and were near the bottom of the league in blocked shots. Marvin Bagley III, a recently drafted big man the team hopes to build around alongside De’Aron Fox, only played 13 games last season due to injury. Positive Kings news is rare, but Sacramento finally found some luck in picking up Iowa State guard Tyrese Haliburon in the draft, who can shoot it from distance, defend, and distribute. Let’s not kid ourselves, though. This is not a playoff team. The Kings lost a key offensive piece in allowing Bogdan Bogdanovic to walk, a move that will hurt them this season but likely help them financially down the road.

  So what else is here? Sacramento’s roster boasts a couple of other dudes that are decent players, but are overpaid relative to their contributions and are not going to move the needle against teams with star power (Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes). For this team to even break the top ten in record, Fox would have to make a jump (which would require his distance shooting to improve), Bagley would have to stay healthy, and Hassan Whiteside would have to actually play hard in a non-contract year. There are some reasons to be optimistic for Sacramento fans, but this team is still a couple of years away from competing.

          Last season: 44-28, fifth in Western Conference, lost in first round

      OKC was a bigger surprise than Sephiroth in Smash Ultimate last season, snagging the fifth seed despite the Russell Westbrook/Chris Paul trade. The Thunder have now shifted phases into full rebuild mode after trading Paul to the Phoenix Suns, shipping sturdy center Steven Adams to Philadelphia for Al Horford, and sending Dennis Schröder to the Lakers. While Thunder fans have a lot to be excited about with a war chest of draft picks over the coming years and the continued development of young talent like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and draft pick Aleksej Pokuševski, this is not a franchise that is attempting to make the playoffs this season.
