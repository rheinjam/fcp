      Lakers in 7

    <p class="article">
      It’s rare to see a true dark horse make a run to the Finals given the NBA’s seven-game series format, so I’m going with two of the frontrunners this year. In the East, the Bucks are the clear favorite. The presumptive league MVP, a great second scorer and playmaker in Khris Middleton, and defensive stalwarts at point guard and center in Eric Bledsoe and Brook Lopez round out a team that had the league’s top defensive rating and points per game average. L.A. is similarly impressive on offense and defense (4th and 3rd in those ratings respectively) and boasts two of the NBA’s five best players in LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lake Show faces a more difficult road in the West, with the Clippers’ star power and depth standing in the way of a LeBron and AD march to the Finals. Also, the Lakers must overcome a lack of depth with starter Avery Bradley opting out of the bubble and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo out for a round recovering from thumb surgery.

      At first glance, these factors seem to favor Milwaukee. Their superior depth allowed Giannis to only play 30.9 minutes per game compared to Lebron’s 34.9 minutes per game. However, depth is not everything in the NBA, as individual players have a greater impact on team success in this sport more than any other major professional sport. The Lakers will have the best overall player in the series in LeBron James, who has fewer holes in his game than Giannis, who continues to struggle from three and the free throw line. LA’s second-best player, Anthony Davis, is on a completely different level than Khris Middleton, the Bucks’ second star. That aside, Milwaukee relies on a lightning-quick pace and easy transition baskets to run opponents out of the gym. With LeBron controlling the pace of the game and a legitimate post threat to throw the ball into in the half court in Davis, the Lakers will hoist the Larry O’Brien Trophy due to their greater comfort level in executing when the game slows down, gets more physical, and baskets get tougher to come by. Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors provided the blueprint in their six-game win over the Bucks last year, and the King will attempt to execute a similar game plan.

      Seeing that Ben played it smart, it’s my turn to make bold foolish predictions! Sixers! This team has proven nothing over the last few years. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid have not found a way to work well together yet, but I think moving Simmons to the 4 will help this. I’ve watched a good amount of this team over the last few years and haven’t been impressed for the most part. I think the adjustments that Brett Brown is making going into the bubble are going to pay big dividends. Shake Milton is surprisingly great, and when you add a few shooters to the now front-court of Simmons and Embiid I can see them making serious noise come playoff time. The reason that I have them going to the finals is that nothing seems to bother Giannis Antetokounmpo, except for size. Throwing Embiid and Horford (off the bench) at him and packing the paint gives them a solid chance of pulling the upset.

      The Clippers have the best chance of making it out of the wild, wild west. This is due, in large part, to their depth. I don’t think another team in the league matches them, except for Milwaukee (luckily in the Eastern Conference). When the second unit comes in, the Clippers can compete with the starters of most squads. Paul George and Kawhi Leonard have had a long rest, and George in particular, looks the healthiest he has in years. Combine the play of their stars, with shooters, defensive specialists, and Doc Rivers and I think they have an advantage over every team in the West. I could see Lebron and company beat them in a 7 game series, but apart from that they should easily dispatch any other team in the West.
