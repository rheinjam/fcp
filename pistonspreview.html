        In what has to go down as one of the most aggressive offseasons in league history, the Detroit Pistons are looking, to once again, be competitive in the Eastern Conference. Last season was an unmitigated disaster. Blake Griffin remained injured, and Derrick Rose’s best efforts led to a 20-46 record before the league was suspended in March. Management also moved away from Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson, two talented, but flawed players who never gave Detroit a serious chance of winning. Players like Christian Wood and Luke Kennard played solidly, but not enough for them to remain on the team going into this year.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      Pistons fans for the most part were ecstatic after this year’s draft. Killian Hayes could be the future of the team. He will look to make an immediate impact and may very well start for the team at the beginning of the regular season. At only 19 years of age Hayes definitely has some holes in his game, but he’s talented and will give the Pistons an offensive boost. Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart also add talent and size, and the Pistons are hoping at least one of them finds a way to earn solid minutes in their rookie seasons.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        If the draft was a reason for fans to get excited, free agency may be the complete opposite. The Pistons, are unfortunately not a team that free agents target. Therefore, management is completely reliant on the draft, trades, or signing lesser players to large contracts. It was all about the latter this offseason, with the Pistons overpaying for Mason Plumlee and Jerami Grant. Mason Plumlee is not worth 8 million dollars a year, especially when they already added size through the draft. Jerami Grant had a great season with the Nuggets. I don’t want to take that away from him. The problem will be when he’s expected to carry the Pistons scoring on some nights. He worked well in Denver because he complemented Murray and Jokic. The Pistons don’t have nearly the level of talent that Denver has, so Grant will have a larger role. What he does with it is something that time will tell, but I’m doubtful that he will be as effective.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      The decision to not offer Christian Wood a sizable contract may come back to shoot the Pistons in the foot. When Drummond was sent to Cleveland, Wood flourished. Scoring nearly 23 points and pulling down almost 10 boards a game, Wood appeared to be the big man of the future for the squad. <a class="video-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7DKSRrmCws" target="_blank">Finding a player of his size, who can dribble, has post moves, and can shoot threes is difficult.</a> The only idea that I can come up with is that behind the scenes the Pistons management knows something that the public was not made aware of. Maybe they didn’t think the level he was playing at was sustainable? I hope they are right, because if he turns out to be an All-Star caliber player on the Rockets, Pistons fans will remember this decision as a blunder for many years to come.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
      The Pistons may be able to compete for a playoff spot. The roster is a hodgepodge of talent, but sometimes these things have a way of working themselves out. A lot will fall on the shoulders of Killian Hayes and Blake Griffin. Will Killian Hayes be able to jump into NBA games and play effectively? Will Blake Griffin manage to stay healthy for the first time in years? Even if Blake Griffin does stay healthy, I’ll be surprised if he plays at the level he used to.
