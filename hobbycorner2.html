        Welcome back to the Hobby Corner!

        Welcome back to the Hobby Corner! It’s been a while since our introductory article, and since then the sports card hobby has continued to take off.
      </p>

      <p class="article">
        Throughout the summer we’ve seen some rare cards from some of the stars in all sports go for eye-popping numbers. In mid-July a Lebron James rookie patch autograph card sold for $1.8 million dollars at auction (ESPN story here) setting the
        record for the most expensive basketball card sold. In early August we also saw a sealed case of 1986 Fleer Basketball cards sell for nearly $1.8 million as well, the main attraction here being the chance at finding (very likely) one or
        multiple original Michael Jordan rookie cards. A pack of these cards back in 1986 would have cost you $0.40. LOL. Is there even anything you can buy right now that costs $0.40? Maybe a single Tootsie Roll? Idk.
        <br>
        <img class="articlepicture1" src="pictures/mjcard.png" alt="">
        <br>
        This explosion isn’t exclusive to basketball either. Just last week a Mike Trout autograph rookie card has sold for $3.93 million dollars. This too has set the record for the most expensive card sold within it’s sport, surpassing Honus
        Wagner. I’m not sure who randomly wanted an Honus Wagner card that bad, but as my mother likes to say, “there’s a lid for every pot”. And then there’s this…
      </p>
      <br>
      <img class="articlepicture1" src="pictures/tatiscard.png" alt="">
      <br>
      <p class="article">
        Let that sink in for a second. Fernando Tatis is lighting the major leagues on fire right now, but this is only his second year in the league. If he ends up taking over Mike Trout as the best player in baseball, I can only imagine what this
        same card will resell for 5 or 10 years down the road.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        So yeah…if this doesn’t open your eyes to the potential of investing in sports cards, I don’t know what will.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        So you’re ready to jump in and buy some cards, but where do you start? Well, there’s essentially two tiers of sports cards you can buy either in stores or online. The first is Retail. These are cards you can find at your local Walmart or
        Target on the shelves near the cash registers. Retail is your cheaper option of the two, but with a lower cost comes a lower chance of finding that one card that nets you a down payment on a house. That’s not to say that you can’t find any
        good cards in retail boxes or packs though. Many retail sets will include autograph cards and all include the chance to find many of the sought after rookies like Zion or Ja Morant. Recently however, retail products have been running into the
        problem of collectors bulk buying products right off the shelves (online and in person) to then resell on the open market (eBay, Twitter and other places). A prime example of this is the recently released NBA Chronicles set from Panini* which
        hit stores in early August. At retail a “Mega Box” of 100 cards sells for $49.99, but during the week of Aug 3 – Aug 9 this sold for up to $300 on eBay. Resale prices have settled a bit since then, but you can see the value of this market at
        its peak even for sealed boxes of cards. Overall, I would say retail is a great option to start out with IF you can find it at a fair price.
        <br>
        *(the card manufacturing company, not a sandwich)
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="article">
        Your second option is the Hobby category. Hobby boxes of cards come at a much higher price than retail, but typically is the only way you’re able to find certain autograph, memorabilia (patches of player’s jerseys or equipment embedded in the
        card) or other rare numbered/parallel cards (we’ll get into these in the next article). Hobby boxes cannot be found in local retail stores (usually because they’re way too expensive), so the place to look would be either online or at a local
        card shop (LCS as it’s known in the hobby*). To give you a price comparison, remember that $50 mega box of Chronicles we talked about? A hobby box of Chronicles sells for anywhere between $800 - $1,000 and includes only contains 48 cards. The
        draw here being a guarantee of 2 autograph cards per box. It’s a pretty big gamble with the jackpot again being a Zion or Ja autograph card. If you don’t want to buy a whole box you can typically buy single packs at your LCS for a fraction of
        the cost. Your budget will definitely dictate whether you want to go the hobby route, but the potential payout can be out of control.
        <br>
        *yes, I feel super cool writing that…
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        A lot of people aren’t interested in spending hundreds of dollars on cards, which is perfectly understandable. Your alternative option here would be a card “Break”. You can find breaks online (I enjoy using Twitter and eBay), held by LCS owners or other collectors. A break is a group opening of a set of cards, either a hobby box or a group of retail boxes, that people can buy into. You can typically buy in for a random team, or pay a set amount for the team that you want. The person hosting the break will open the cards live on camera for everyone else to watch virtually. Any players that come out of the packs in the break belonging to the team that was assigned to you, will then be yours and will be mailed to you. It’s another affordable option and provides some entertainment value and excitement in seeing what cards everyone gets. <a href="https://twitter.com/NortheastBreaks/status/1298055613407268866?s=20 ">Here is a link to a break with the guys at Northeast Breaks,</a> who I’ve done a couple breaks with myself.

        Hopefully this post sparks some interest with you gives some insight into card collecting. With all of the talk around the Panini Chronicles set, I was able to get a hold of some myself. Below are some of the highlights I pulled.
