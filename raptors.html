    By James Rhein
    <p class="article">
      Last night was a glimpse into how dangerous the Toronto Raptors are for any team in the league. The Lakers, coming off a huge victory opening night against the Clippers, looked unprepared for playing against the defending champions. Lebron and Davis were held in check, and no one else on the Lakers was able to step up. At times the Lakers moved the ball well, but the Raptors flew to the open man all night. The amount of pressure that they are able to put on teams is reminiscent of a recent college team that I want to forget about. Texas Tech, I’m looking at you. As a fan of basketball it’s incredibly fun to see professional athletes trying so hard night in and night out.

      What makes the defense of the Raptors so hard to go against? They can play a variety of different defensive schemes and each player that plays significant minutes doesn’t need help often. When they do need help (against Giannis and the Bucks for example), a second man can come over so quickly they can stop drives to the basket. This is a major reason that the Raptors can beat anyone. Yesterday against the Lakers their defense was on full display. The Lakers were forced into careless turnovers and had to settle for more three pointers than they care to shoot. The fact that they shot them at such a low percentage didn’t help, but the Raptor’s defense contributed to it.

      Their defense is the reason that the Raptors can beat anyone come playoff time. They match up very well against the Bucks, and are perhaps the only team that does, except for the Sixers. Slow Giannis down, and you have yourself a chance. I can easily see them coming out of the East, or at the very least taking the best teams in the East to 6 or 7 games. I picked the Sixers to make it to the finals, not because I believed in them, but because I wanted to make a crazy prediction. In all likelihood, it’s going to come down to the Eastern Conference Finals with the Bucks playing the Raptors. After being up 2-0 on the Raptors last year, the Bucks lost 4 straight, with Giannis’ usual contributions being negated by incredible defense. The same thing could happen this year, even without having Kawhi.

    <p class="article">
      I will be keeping a close eye on the Raptors over the next few games in the bubble. Can they keep the pressure up?
