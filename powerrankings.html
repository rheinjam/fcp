        Who else was it going to be? The defending champions, coming off an impressive run in the bubble, are more than ready to make another run at a second championship. They’ve improved their roster, adding depth with players like Dennis Schroder and Marc Gasol, while keeping their core players under contract. Lebron James, entering year 18, shows no signs of slowing down. Unless bitten by the injury bug, the cruelest of all bugs, this team should at the very least have a deep playoff run in them.

        2. Miami Heat
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        This is where you start the year if you decide to run it back (or close to) with a team as deep as any other in the league. If healthy I truly believe they would have pushed the Lakers to 7 games and potentially won the championship. Bam Adebayo was a revelation last year and is only going to get better from here. His shoulder injury from last season is worrisome, but if healthy look out. Jimmy Butler had the best season of his career and at the age of 31, there is no reason to expect him to decline in his abilities. Mix the talent of Bam and Butler in with Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic, and it’s a recipe for a team that can compete with any other team in the league.

        3. Brooklyn Nets
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Brooklyn may very well be the deepest team in the league. Of course, this depth is dependent on their two returning stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I don’t trust that either of these players is going to look like themselves, especially at the beginning of the year. Durant in particular, coming off the worst injury that a basketball player can experience, may never look like the same player. He’ll be able to shoot and play his usual offensive role, but the quick lateral movement required for defense may make him far less effective on that end of the floor. Irving, in my mind, can never be trusted. His list of injuries is long and continues to grow longer with each season. When he’s out on the floor he’s undoubtedly one of the best offensive players in the league, but it seems to be becoming a rarer and rarer occurrence. Outside of Durant and Irving, the Nets have a solid foundation in Caris LaVert, Jarett Allen, Joe Harris, and former Piston (had to) Spencer Dinwiddie. Brooklyn is must watch T.V this year and all eyes will be on them. Steve Nash, recently hired as the head coach, faces a healthy amount of pressure because of the talent on his squad.

        4. Los Angeles Clippers
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        After spending the last few months as the laughingstock of the league, the Clippers are ready for a bounce back season. Coming back psychologically from blowing a 3-1 lead is difficult to do, but this team is more than capable of it. I don’t buy Paul George’s excuses for a minute. Coaching and the bubble environment were no doubt difficult, but even those can’t explain his atrocious play. Kawhi has remained silent as usual about last season, but he will want more from his team, which is for the most part the same team as last year. The one major change is losing Montrezl Harrell to the Lakers, but adding Serge Ibaka will help the Clippers on the defensive end of the floor. Defense was what the Clippers were built on, and will continue to be their focus. Let’s hope Tyronne Lue is up for the challenge of coaching a team which could be ugly behind the scenes. The pressure is on Paul George’s shoulders this year. If the Clippers get bounced from the playoffs early, he will never hear the end of it.

      <p class="articleheading">
        5. Milwaukee Bucks
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Recent playoff history would say that it’s unwise to put them this high, but in terms of talent, the Milwaukee Bucks belong here. They have the best regular season player in the league of the last few years in Giannis Antetokounmpo, who many are predicting will finally get over his playoff woes. Count me in as cautiously optimistic that the Bucks will look different in the playoffs this year. Giannis will have to do it with a team that arguably has less talent than last year’s team. The trading of Eric Bledsoe and George Hill for Jrue Holiday not only diminished the Bucks greatest strength (their depth), but may also start to chip away at their team chemistry. George Hill was a leader for this team, and it’s going to be difficult for Holiday to have the same impact.

      <p class="articleheading">
        6. Denver Nuggets
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Denver Nuggets remain a deep squad, and with Jamaal Murray playing at such a high level this team is built to beat most teams. Nikola Jokic remains a top ten player in the league and if he finds the next gear and shows up in shape, Denver is going to get off to a hot start. They lost Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee to the Pistons, but I’m not expecting this to affect them. Questions do surround this team, but having two stars players should help even if some players don’t live up to expectations. Bol Bol is expected to play more than he did last year, and Nuggets fans are hopeful that Gary Harris returns to his usual serviceable self. Michael Porter Jr. also shined for the Nuggets at times last season, so expect a major contribution from him this year.

      7. Boston Celtics
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        It shouldn’t, but the season may very well come down to the health of Kemba Walker’s knee. Without Kemba, the team is still deep and likely in deep playoff contention, but not championship bound. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart are as good of a core to build around as any team has in the league. But factor in the loss of Gordon Hayward in free agency, with the aforementioned injury concerns, and you have a team that could disappoint people. Boston was one of the few teams to play true small ball last year, and as proven many times in the past it does work in the regular season. But come playoffs, all of these teams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwLNTlNHv0" target="_blank">hit a wall</a> at some point. Last year their wall was Bam. This year fans should expect more of the same, but at least they went out and got a little more size in Tristan Thompson. He’s not the best, but he does play hard and can rebound with the best of them.

        8. Dallas Mavericks
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        If you don’t like watching the Mavericks, you don’t like NBA basketball. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXaZ_0NE2TQ" target=_"blank">Luka Doncic</a> is the most fun player to come into the league in several years. Not super athletic, he depends on his smarts and skill to have the impact he does for his team. At only 21 years of age, it’s scary to think of how good he will be in a few years. The health of Kristaps Porzingis is the largest concern, and reports put him out until at least January. Seth Curry was also traded away for Josh Richardson, a better defender, but not an elite shooter. For many of the teams ranked above the Mavericks, depth was a strength. This is not true for the Mavericks. They are built similarly to Houston in that the ball is in the hand of one player for most of the game. That said, at least their star knows how to get their teammates involved.

      <p class="articleheading">
        9. Golden State Warriors
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Look I get it. I’m putting the Warriors way too high on this list. The team that made 5 consecutive NBA Finals looks to be no more. Klay Thompson tore his Achilles and now will miss his second consecutive year. Draymond Green looked like a shell of his former self last year, in part due to injuries. He’s likely the second most talented player on this team. Golden State did go out and get some talent with the likes of Kelly Oubre, but he will not be enough to fill in for the hole left with Thompson’s absence. I’m guessing that the Warriors will drop significantly in my rankings after the first few weeks of the season, but that’s the fun of it all. Stephen Curry’s otherworldly talent makes you think that a team will perform way better than they likely will.

      <p class="articleheading">
        10. Utah Jazz
      </p>
      <p class="article">
         The Utah Jazz are not a team that garners a lot of national attention, but they are among the most talented teams in the league. Last season Rudy Gobert, their starting center, contracted the coronavirus and made a fool of himself joking about it. Somehow, he didn’t lose the support of his teammates and the Jazz went on to play the Nuggets in the most memorable series of the bubble. Donovan Mitchell is an absolute monster and could come back an even better player this year. Bogdanovic will also be back from injury. If he had been healthy, the Nuggets probably wouldn’t have made it past the first round. The Jazz made no significant changes to their roster. In order to again be one of the better teams in the West, they hope to get more out of Michael Conley, who regressed last year.

      <p class="articleheading">
        11. Portland Trailblazers
      </p>
      <p class="article">
         Portland was one of the better teams in the bubble in Orlando. Unfortunately a    back injury for CJ McCollum and a rough matchup with the Lakers, cut their postseason short. The Portland Trailblazers have one of the better starting fives in the league, especially now that Jusef Nurkic has recovered from injury. He looked like his former self in the bubble; which is to say, one of the top ten big men in the league and a walking double double. It will be interesting to see what Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. are able to add to the team, but if they play halfway decently, I think Portland will be a top 4 seed in the West. Damian Lillard is one of the most talented players the NBA has, and will be on a mission to show it again this year.

        12. Philadelphia 76ers
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Sixers are like the cheating partner that you take back, expecting that it will be different this time around. No one should have faith in this team. I foolishly put them to get to the finals last year, only to again watch them collapse due to poor team chemistry. This iteration of the Sixers is a little different, but now they seem to have just replaced some of their shooters with different shooters. Danny Green and Seth Curry are the newest additions to the team. Now that Brett Brown was finally let go, maybe Doc Rivers will take the reigns and run with it. The fundamental problem of the squad has always been the chemistry between Embiid and Simmons. Maybe a trade is still in the works and Simmons won’t make it very far into the season as a Sixer. Reports are also coming out that Tobias Harris has made a jump this year as well, and perhaps this is a sign to be more optimistic about the team. Either way, the fanbase wants to see Embiid put forth the effort he’s capable of on a daily basis.

      <p class="articleheading">
        13. Houston Rockets
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The biggest wild card and perhaps the hardest team to put in this power ranking. James Harden continues to be a major source of discussion around the league, after demanding he be traded. Of course, he spent the last few weeks partying it up in Vegas and showed up to Tuesday night’s preseason game in horrendous shape. I have no sympathy for James Harden. When you go around not social distancing and not wearing a mask it’s pretty darn hard to root for you. I hope the Rockets trade him to a team that has no chance of competing for a championship. Anway, I digress. The Rockets added both John Wall and Demarcus Cousins, both of whom are coming back from significant injuries. This team could be fun to watch, especially with their other big addition Christian Wood. I’m hoping for the Rockets fanbase that the team parts with James Harden and is able to pick up some other solid pieces for him. Houston could be an entertaining team if they lose the extra weight that is now James Harden.

        14. Phoenix Suns
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Phoenix Suns are going to be a team to watch. I haven’t thought this highly of the squad in over a decade, back when Steve Nash was running pick and rolls with Amare. Deandre Ayton is looking to play a full season, Devin Booker is an incredible talent, and the Suns picked up Chris Paul. These three players are enough to make any team competitive and I see the Suns holding their own in a talented West. We already saw what they were capable of without Chris Paul in the bubble last season. Going undefeated was something that no one expected and they pulled it off with excellent team ball.

        15. Memphis Grizzlis
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Grizzlies are a young up and coming squad. Ja Morant, winner of last year’s Rookie of the Year Award, looks to continue his aggressive style of play. Jaren Jackson Jr. unfortunately went down with an injury and the team that played in the bubble didn’t look like the team from the beginning of the year. Outside of these two players they are a little sapped for talent. The chemistry that they were able to develop together last year was the reason the team was as successful as they were. I look for them to remain where they were in the West last year, but they are a team capable of surprising people.

        16. Washington Wizards
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The new look Washington Wizards! John Wall and Russell Westbrook have swapped places, in what was the biggest trade of the offseason. I think this team could potentially work. Russell Westbrook plays about as hard as anyone I’ve seen and Bradley Beal quietly had one of the best season’s a shooting guard has had over the last decade. If he were on a more historically great team he would have got the attention that he deserved. Similarly to Memphis, outside of their star two players the roster is pretty barren. Ish Smith for what’s it worth is a great backup player and is capable of running the second unit efficiently. Expect the Wizards to be in the playoff hunt.

        17. Toronto Raptors
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Ever since winning the championship, the Raptors are seeing pieces of their team move away. First Kawhi and now Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol. That’s a lot of size to lose, but the Raptors still have talent in Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam. Siakam, in particular, struggled in the bubble. During the regular season I remember hearing him in the discussion for most improved player, but after his performance in the bubble I’m not as high on him. They also added Aron Baynes to deal with their loss of size, and he’s an underrated player. The main reason I have the Raptors so high is that they still have one, if not the best coach in the league, in Nick Nurse. The Raptors will compete every game and this is why they will be in the playoff hunt.

        18. New Orleans Pelicans
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Zion! What else was I going to say? He’s the reason that everyone will watch the Pelicans, and he will be responsible for how far the Pelicans go this year. The team looks very different from last year. Brandon Ingram remains on the squad, but the trading of Jrue Holiday for Eric Bledsoe is going to have a major impact here. Bledsoe is not nearly as talented as Holiday, especially offensively. The Pelicans did also add Steven Adams and I’m a big fan of this move. Steven Adams plays hard and hustles and I think mixing him with Zion will help take a little pressure off of him. The Pelicans will compete; Ingram and Zion are too talented for them not to.

        19. Indiana Pacers
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        I may regret putting the Pacers so low in my preseason rankings because of the level of talent on this roster. T.J. Warren looked like a Top 20 player in the bubble, but I’m not sure that is sustainable. Oladipo and Sabonis are also back from injury, but I’m not hopeful that Oladipo will make it through the season. His history of injuries is piling up. When healthy, he’s a fantastic all around player, and can have the Pacers competing with most of the teams in the East. I’m not expecting much from the Pacers due to injuries, but if they stay healthy, look for them to be playoff bound.

        20. Charlotte Hornets
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        They may not be at the top of my power rankings, but they would be close to the top of my league pass rankings. LaMelo Ball has already shown in the preseason his freekish passing ability, and Miles Bridges (Go Green!) athleticism seems to complement this perfectly. It’s going to be a highlight factory in Charlotte, but I don’t see them winning many games. As fun as Lamelo Ball is, he’s not a great shooter or defender and this will be problematic, especially with the amount of elite guards in the league. He’s not likely to start at the beginning of the season, but we will see as the season continues if he continues to come off the bench. The starters aren’t impressive; Gordon Hayward’s agent got him an amazing contract with the Hornets, but he’s arguably the most talented player on the roster.

        21. Atlanta Hawks

      <p class="article">
        The Hawks are attempting to put new pieces around their young All-Star Trae Young, but I don’t see it working out the way they are envisioning it. Bogdan Bogdanovic is a great complementary piece to the winning puzzle, but outside of that none of the players on this roster stand out as supremely talented. Expect a lot of pick and roll with Young and Clint Capela to generate easy points, but I can see this team giving up points left and right. The Atlanta Hawks will be an entertaining team, but nothing more. Fans can hope for a playoff berth and while that may happen, it would be such a low seeding that they would get crushed in the first round.

      <p class="article">
        The Spurs dynasty is starting to evaporate and evaporate quickly. Lamarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan are still talented, but both of their games are tailored towards the NBA of ten years ago. Neither is the elite three point shooter that the team needs them to be. It would be different if they were a Lebron James style player, but they aren’t fantastic playmakers either. Scorers? Sure? But that’s enough to carry the Spurs to a playoff berth. The rest of the roster continues to age and with the talent level present in the rest of their conference, they are in trouble.

        Ugh. We’ve gotten to the point of the power rankings, in which the rosters become painfully awful. Thank goodness De’Aaron Fox is on this team because outside of him you have Bagley, Barnes, Holmes, and Whiteside. Yes, Buddy Hield is still on the team, but I remain unimpressed by him. If you are a Kings fan, this is going to be another painful year. Fox is at least fun to watch, and may very well be the fastest player in the league. The Sacramento Kings will win some games that they have no business being in, but playoffs are out of the question.

        I’m glad that Markelle Fultz gave an indication last season of the player he could become. Vucevic is underrated and Aaron Gordon’s athleticism can keep them in games, but the Magic are going to disappoint again this year. They’ve made the playoffs the last few years, but as the East becomes more talented, I see the Magic getting pushed out of the playoff picture.

      <p class="article">
        Anthony Edwards was the number one pick in the draft and looks to make an impact right away. Karl-Anthony Towns is a tremendous player, but after experiencing such tragedy in his personal life, it remains to see what kind of player will be coming back. I stand with everyone else in wishing the best for Towns and hoping he has the year he is capable of. De’Angelo Russell is a talented player, but my expectations for him are not high. The Minnesota Timberwolves could be in playoff contention if they develop team chemistry.

        26. Detroit Pistons
      </p>
      <p class="article">
         No one knows what the Pistons were thinking during free agency. Yet again, lesser players were given contracts essentially stopping the Pistons from making any key additions in the near future. Jerami Grant for 3 years and 60 million? Mason Plumlee for 3 years and 25 million? Pistons management did much better during draft night picking Killian Hayes and a few other talented players. For what it’s worth though, Killian Hayes has been looking absolutely atrocious in preseason so far. Derrick Rose and Blake Griffin are back, but with both of them having a long injury history, it’s difficult to say if either will produce at a high level. Expectations are incredibly low for a Pistons squad that is likely going to miss the playoffs again.

        Shai Gilgeous-Alexander remains on the roster and OKC fans should be thankful for this. Because apart from him, the rest of the roster is thin as can be. Al Horford joins the squad and Lu Dort is still here! George Hill will be a veteran presence that the locker room will need, but after the departures of Dennis Schroder and Chris Paul, this team will struggle against most teams in the league. Sam Presti is planning to dismantle this team and his collection of draft picks is impressive. It won’t be too many years before OKC is again a powerhouse.

      <p class="article">
        Should I be this low on the Bulls in the preseason? My friends tell me no, but I think this team is just plain awful. Sure, Zach Lavine is a great player, and Coby White showed flashes of brilliance last season, but I can’t see the Bulls making much noise in the league. Lauri Markkanen looked like he was going to turn into quite the player, but injuries have derailed that. I’ll have more to say about the Bulls after I see them play a few games.

        At least Kevin Love was able to play a few seasons with Lebron and win a championship. Now he has no one to help, outside of maybe Andre Drummond. Sexton had a disappointing rookie campaign, but perhaps he will be better this year. This version of the Cavaliers will be the worst team on the floor every night, unless of course they are playing the next team.

      <p class="article">
        Oh, to be a Knicks fan. At least they’ve won in the past, but for such a huge market to have this bad of a team is beyond miserable. Julius Randle and R.J. Barett headline a team that very well may not win 20 games. This team does not have the three point shooting to compete with any team in the league, and will have to rely on defense to try and win games. Good luck New York. You are going to need it.
