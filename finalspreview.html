        Los Angeles Lakers vs. Miami Heat
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        We’ve made it. After a few months in the Orlando bubble we are finally down to two teams. One expected, one unexpected. The Los Angeles Lakers are going to play the Miami Heat, who may just be playing the best basketball of any team this
        season. How have the Heat managed this? By playing a variety of defensive schemes, including a zone defense that has given teams fits. Miami’s speed, attention to detail, and chemistry appear unmatched. On the other side of the ball is a team
        that will need to use their size to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Los Angeles Lakers worried their fanbase, including myself, early on in the bubble. They lost games and appeared to be nowhere near as dominant as they looked before the NBA shutdown in March. But if anyone has learned anything over the
        last decade of watching basketball, it’s to never count out Lebron James. He consistently finds a way to get his teammates to play at a high level. The Lakers are a squad that has two star players and not a whole lot else. Kuzma is always
        known as the third most talented player on the roster, but there is a massive drop in skill between him and Davis. Depth has and will continue to be a question mark for the Lakers especially as they go against a deep Heat team.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Heat may not have the best two players of the series, but they likely have the next best four. Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, and Tyler Herro are better than any Lakers outside of Lebron and Davis. The Heat are faster, have
        better shooters, and have shown up night in and night out since play resumed. Playoff experience is not on this team’s side as Lebron James has been to Finals ten times now. Sure, they have Iggy and Spo but none of the starters have played in
        this situation. This would be more of a factor with home court advantage and fans cheering. Sure, there is still pressure on the players, but it won’t seem drastically different from other rounds.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        This is going to be a fascinating matchup. The Lakers have the size, and the Heat have the speed. Lebron and company are favored heavily, but not everyone, including me is sure that they should be. The Heat have played out of their minds and
        have multiple players that can step up. The Lakers only have two players they can depend on in big games. I know Lebron and Davis will be aggressive, but Davis finds himself in his toughest matchup of the playoffs. Usually Davis either plays
        someone with size or speed, but in Bam Adebayo he will play someone who has both. Mix that with possibly the best blocking ability of anyone in the league and this could be a tough series for Davis.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        I’m very much looking forward to this because I think there are going to be games where both teams score less than one hundred points. We have two teams that focus on the defensive end more than the offensive end. As someone who is enjoying
        the high point totals less and less, I think this is going to be a little bit of a throwback series. This is a hard one to predict. My heart tells me to go Lakers, but my brain tells me to go with the Heat. I’ve been going against the Lakers
        in each series and so far it’s been good luck.
