      Clippers vs. Trailblazers
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    This was the game for Portland. The one that was going to give them a clear advantage in getting the 8 seed. The hardest game remaining on their schedule. What did they do? They dun blew it. Or should I say, Dame Lillard threw it away at the end. Two missed free throws and a poor decision not to go to basket for a quick two gave the Clippers the victory. It was an unfortunate end to a game, that up until that point had been one of the best games in the bubble. Players were trash talking to each other, hitting big shots, and the action went back and forth.

      Portland should still be feared, and they play again later today. If they win today over the Sixers, which I think they will, they will take another step into securing that 8 spot. They desperately need the win too, because the Suns and Spurs are hot on their heels. Carmelo is playing way better than most people thought he would, and Gary Trent Jr. is shooting a whopping 66% from three point land. No one wants to see this team come playoff time, as I expect they will make some serious noise.

      Lakers vs. Pacers
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    What is going on with the Lakers? Is it because the one seed is all locked up or are there bigger issues going on? Being the Lakers comes with a level of scrutiny that no other team in the league faces. Writers and analysts tend to exaggerate the Lakers’ woes after losses. I’m prefacing with this because I don’t want to fall under that category. As I watch more and more of the Lakers in the bubble, I feel like the team that I watched all year is missing. Outside of Lebron James and Anthony Davis this team has no one to turn to right now on the offensive end of the floor. They also aren’t playing with much effort, outside of Lebron. They need to develop a rhythm if they are hoping to not be upset by the likely eight seed (Portland).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    The Lakers lost to the Pacers yesterday in another lackluster effort. Davis had an uncharacteristic awful game shooting 3-14 from the field. He wasn’t the only one with that exact shooting percentage. Welcome Kyle Kuzma a.k.a Mr. Inconsistent. The Lakers need Kuzma. They do not have a third option outside of him. Quinn Cook had himself a game yesterday, but I wouldn’t count on him in huge moments. The Lakers offense is sputtering and while their defense remains strong, certain matchups in the West will force the Lakers to develop some sort of offense if they are to advance.

      On a side note, TJ Warren, I see you.

      Bucks vs. Mavericks
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
  I missed this game! I only saw the highlights. This must have been the game of the bubble. Overtime! Luka Doncic with the most ridiculous stat line I’ve ever seen with 36 points, 14 rebounds, and 19 Assists! The stars going back and forth! Role Players hitting timely shots! I can’t believe I missed this one. The Mavericks showed that they are in any game with their offense. Their defense, based on the highlights I watched, was better than previous games. I’m very much looking forward to the first round matchup between them and either the Clippers or the Nuggets. How great would it be if Luka Doncic managed to knock out the Clippers?
