      Milwaukee vs. Miami
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      On Thursday’s podcast I said that I was still taking the Bucks over the Heat. As of last night that prediction would appear to be a foolish one. The Bucks again stumbled, with no besides Lopez or Giannis playing well. Giannis appeared injured at a few points during the game, and that’s the only reason anyone can think of to explain why he is playing such limited minutes in a must win games. The Heat have been better in every game this series and they are likely to sweep the title favorite in the next game. Jimmy Butler is playing his best basketball of the season, but unlike Giannis he can depend on his teammates if he doesn’t have it one night.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
When the Bucks lose I think Coach Budenholzer is out. You can’t have the regular season you have and then get swept in the playoffs. It will also be interesting to see what happens to Giannis after next season. I don’t think there is any chance of Giannis getting traded, unless he demands it or the Bucks are worried about him leaving in free agency. I was a fan of the Bucks and what they were putting together. Teams that haven’t won a championship in a while are always more exciting than franchises that are constantly successful. It’s part of the reason that watching Toronto win last year was so special. Alas, it looks as though we are headed to an Eastern Conference Finals with the Miami Heat in it. I guess I can continue to root for Duncan Robinson.

      Houston vs. LA
    </p>
    <p class="article">
    My favorite team against my least favorite team. The Houston Rockets narrowly avoided getting upset in the first round and found themselves against the top seed in the West. On paper, the Rockets match up well against the Lakers. They showed why people were thinking that the Lakers might be in trouble in this matchup. I was all aboard the Trailblazers bandwagon against the Lakers in the first round. Injuries and defensive adjustments quickly changed that series to favor the Lakers. Now the Lakers face a whole new challenge in the small ball Houston Rockets.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      If the Rockets shoot well from three, the Lakers are sunk. Yesterday, that very thing happened. Part of this was due to just the shot making ability of Harden and company, but another part of it was defensive lapses by the Lakers. Sure, the Lakers can feed Davis everytime and he can shoot over any Rocket’s defender. Most of his baskets come in the paint or inside the three point line, and that isn’t the best way to beat Houston. The Rockets rely so much on the three ball they can shoot most teams out of the gym. The Lakers don’t have the speed or the defensive guards to put up the fight that is needed. I still think it’s going to be a long series, but I don’t feel confident in picking the Lakers.
