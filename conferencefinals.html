    By James Rhein
    <p class="article">
      Well, here we are people. The NBA playoffs are winding down, the school year has started, and I need to be more deliberate in finding time to just sit and write. It becomes even trickier when you add in the start of the NFL regular season and you find yourself again tricked in rooting for a team that has proven nothing to you in over twenty years.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The second round of the NBA playoffs is going to end with nothing more than a whimper. Yes, we had the excellent Celtics Raptors series, in which the Celtics won a thrilling game seven. But looking elsewhere upon the round two landscape, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed. The Heat throttled the Bucks, not giving them a chance to make it interesting. The Lakers did the same to the Rockets, and again made me think that I need to stop doubting the team I have the most rooted interest in. Out West, the other series would appear to be over as well. That’s not to say the Nuggets couldn’t come back and force a Game 7, but with Kawhi Leonard I can’t see the Clippers losing it.*
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      This all sets up for what should be one of the more enjoyable conference finals in recent years. A Heat Celtics series that no one saw coming, and a Clippers Lakers series that everyone has wanted to see since the beginning of the year. The great thing about all of these teams is that they play team basketball. They each have multiple players they can rely on to score the ball (except maybe the Lakers), and for the most part play as a cohesive unit. This will be in stark contrast to the Rockets, who I think every basketball fan not based in Houston, is thrilled about. I think both series are going to go to at least six games, but it’s very hard to pick who will win.
    </p>

    The Heat have an advantage in Bam, but the guard play of the Celtics is superior in my mind. So far, Heat players like Herro and Goran Dragic have played exceptionally well. That being said, the Heat went against a few teams that didn’t bring the defense intensity that the Celtics are going to bring. Having Brown and Smart is going to help mitigate some of the Heat’s guard play and I think this is going to shift the series in the Celtics favor. My prediction is going to be the Celtics in 7.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Out West, everybody’s dream matchup is about to happen. Lebron and Davis vs. Kawhi and P.G. Paul George is playing much better since the beginning of the playoffs and Kawhi has and will likely continue to be the most consistent player in the playoffs. Lebron isn’t far behind him in that department and Davis is going to cause all sorts of problems for the Clippers on the inside. This is going to be a slugfest. Both teams play with such a high intensity that I’m anticipating several “fights” breaking out in the first few games. I keep doubting the Lakers and it keeps working so I’m going to pick the Clippers to win in 7. Please prove me wrong again.

      *If Jokic and company manage to pull it off, I’ll tip my hat in their direction and be saddened that my article is ruined.
