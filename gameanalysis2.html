    By James Rhein

      We’ve had a full slate of games today, and tomorrow is more of the same! The day started with the Memphis Grizzlies trying for their first win of the bubble against the Utah Jazz. They still didn’t manage to capture it, in part due to the absence of Jaren Jackson Jr., who tore his meniscus the previous game. The implications of this game were huge and the fact that the Grizzlies suffered another loss does not bode well for their playoff hopes. Portland looks likely to capture the 8 seed now, and the Spurs or Pelicans could come up and grab the 9 seed. Admittedly, I do not want to see a Lakers Grizzlies series. I would have been on board before the injury to Jackson, but now there would be little point to playing those games.

      Elsewhere around the NBA, we had the Spurs lose a close one to the Nuggets, and Philly barely beating the magicless Wizards. The Spurs played their brand of basketball, but Jokic and Michael Porter Jr (he’s been lighting it up) led the Nuggets to the win. Popovich’s squad may be the most impressive of the bubble thus far. No one expected them to make any noise, and here they are competing for the 8/9 seed. I certainly counted them out, but now I’m seeing the error of my ways. The Nuggets also impressed me in this one, and I can see them going far in the playoffs when/if they get back to full health. There aren’t many teams that can deal with a big man like Jokic, who is starting to find his stride a few games into the continuation of the season.

      I picked Philadelphia to make it to the Finals, and if I could go back in time, I would. Not only does this team lack chemistry, but they seem to have no heart. A team that is led by Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant should not even get close to competing with the likes of Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. I would make the argument that four of the five starters on the Sixers are more talented than anyone currently on the Wizards lineup. Yet today, here we are. Philly looked flat all game, wasn’t moving the ball effectively, and the Wizards out hustled them all game. I understand that Ben Simmons got injured (doesn’t look good based on how he was walking), but that’s no excuse for what I saw today. There is no joy when the Sixers play. I don’t think they like playing with each other. Smiles and laughs were few and far between, and even though they needed to focus better, having some enjoyment playing the games makes a difference. I’m not expecting much moving forward from the Sixers. They aren’t going to turn this around and if Ben Simmons is going to miss time, good luck.
