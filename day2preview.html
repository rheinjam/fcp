        Orlando Magic (30-35) v. Brooklyn Nets (30-34)
        2:30 PM EST
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Questionable: Magic: Markelle Fultz & Magic Star Person of Interest
      </p>
      <p class="articleheading">
        Out:
        <br>
        Magic: Jonathan Issac
        <br>
        Nets: Spencer Dwindle, Taureen Prince, Bradely Beal, Wilson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, Kyrie Irving

      <p class="article">
        This is one of the match-ups in the new NBA that will leave us wondering whether or not the restart was worth the cost – to the players, to the NBA, to Disney and to the fans. It’s abundantly clear that the Nets have a decimated roster
        entering the game with the Orlando Magic. While each team has suffered due to the epidemic, few teams can boast the sheer number of team members who will be out for at least the first game.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        When we started the season, the starting five for the Nets consisted of Harris, Prince, Allen, LeVert and Dinwiddie (Irving but who cares). Harris, Allen & LeVert combined for 45 ppg in the regular season. The starters who are not returning
        for the rest of the COVID 2020* season? 35 ppg. Despite Irving getting season ending surgery prior to the beginning of the Coronavirus epidemic, the Nets were competitive in quite a few of their match-ups. Irving is impossible to replace yet
        Dinwiddie did an admirable job filling in until the season was suspended. But now Dinwiddie will not be on the court for the rest of the year and the Nets are in a bit of a pickle.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Magic have certainly had their own struggles prior to the season suspending. Being five games below .500 has them looking solidly at the eight seed. Even though Fultz didn’t average a huge amount of PPG – it could still be difficult to
        watch the Magic find their form in Disney. If another player opts out or catches COVID, it could be difficult to see the team operating at peak efficiency, which was already poor enough during large stretches of the regular season.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Regardless, though, the Magic (and every other team) should annihilate the Nets. On paper, this team is missing most of the teams original rotation players, which even if Phil Jackson was at the helm, would prove to be insurmountable in a
        league based on talent. Since this is still the first game of an abbreviated season, it may get a little wonky and it’s possible that the Nets storm into Disneyland to crush their enemies. But I would put serious cash down that by the time
        these teams find their form again, the Nets will have no chance to win a game, let alone a playoff series.
      <p class="articlepredictions">
        125-92 Magic take the game decisively.

        Phoenix Suns (26-39) v. Washington Wizards (24-40)
        4:00 PM EST
      </p>

      <p class="articleheading">
        Out:
        <br>
	      Suns: Kelly Oubre Jr., Tariq Owens
        <br>
      	Wizards: John Wall, Davis Bertans, Bradley Beal, Gary Payton II

      <p class="article">
        Having twenty two teams back in Orlando is a stellar move by the NBA. The United States are ready to root on most of our favorite teams and bring life back into the competitive world of professional Basketball. With that being said, neither Suns or the Wizards have a chance at sniffing the eight seed in their respective conferences. While it may seem like there is a lot on the line for the contenders, it’s the pretenders match-ups that will only bring joy to the fans of their respective cities. The rest of us will suffer through and wait for better basketball.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Washington Wizards played 64 regular season games before the season concluded. Of those, Bradley Beal was the leading scorer for the Wizards with 44 (69%). At 27, Beal had been averaging over 30 ppg over the course of the regular season for Washington. Scott Brooks has to distribute 20 shots per game out to the rest of the roster and hope that combined, they can also shoot at a 45% clip or better. Usually, coaching can only pull a team so much in one direction – if the court talent is there the team will succeed and vice versa if it’s not. Scott Brooks somehow managed to take one of the most talented teams in the last twenty years and squander years of early playoff exits. He may be an okay coach but there is little chance that he pulls the team up on his own without the team's best offensive weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        While the Phoenix Suns haven’t lost their best player, they do have a bit of a gap to mend on their own side as well with Kelly Oubre Jr. sitting out for the NBA restart. Prior to the season shutting down, the Suns were hovering around .500 for their last ten games. With the talented Devin Booker leading the way (who has had a phenomenal regular season averaging 26 ppg), it’s possible that the Suns have a great opportunity to showcase a revitalized team in Orlando. If we have a chance to see Ricky Rubio leading the offense, there’s a good chance the Suns could become a bit of a thorn in the side of all the teams looking to cakewalk into the playoffs.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Suns have a size and star advantage in this match-up. If the game turns into a run and gun, chuck everything up because no one is playing defense type match, the Wizards will get crushed. They can’t compete with a nearly fully cohesive NBA caliber team when they’re missing their best option.  However, if we do see a slower game, I do think the Wizards have a decent chance to claim the win.

	      Grizzlies: N/A

	      Trailblazers: Trevor Ariza, Rodney Hood, Moses Brown

      <p class="article">
        There is no doubt that both of these teams had found themselves struggling at one point or another during the season. Having a losing record in the Western conference doesn’t automatically make you a bad team, but it definitely more than likely indicates a team that has little chance of making the playoffs, let alone doing any sort of damage. However, if there is one thing that both the Blazers and the Grizzlies have are wicked talented guards. Ja Morant and Damian Lillard are some of the two most exciting players to watch in the league. And in a league dominated by guard play, these two teams could likely have enough juice to make some noise if they can win a few games in the magic city.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        I think all of us at Full Court Press are secretly hoping to see playoff Dame.  The man oozes cool and always makes you feel like he has the game exactly where he wants it. He is electric in every sense of the word, and with that talent there’s a good chance that Damian Lillard can help lead Portland to a playoff berth. But no one at FCP has seen a playoff Ja. The man was phenomenal at Murray State just one year ago and now he’s tearing up the league with the Grizzlies. Can Damian limit Ja’s production? Can Ja do anything to stop the Blazer offense?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        In their lone regular season match-up, the Grizzlies took a decisive victory, holding Lillard to 20 points on 19 shots and holding the rest of the team to a 37% field goal percentage. The Grizzlies have had a middle of the road defense for the season but they have had success with their defensive scheme against Portland. Portland has ranked at the bottom for defense as a team for the season so, especially with players out, it will be up to them to outscore their opponents in Orlando. With that in mind, I think we see a high caliber offensive showdown. It’s a star powered guard showdown in Orlando and we’ve got front row seats.

      <p class="article">
        In the marquee match-up of the day, the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks will square off at 6:30 PM on August 1st. Both teams were victorious on their respective home courts prior to the suspension of the season – however the Celtics had star Gordon Hayward for both games. Hayward has opted out of playing for the remainder of the year, which means that in addition to finding another rotation player, the Celtics will need to replace 17 ppg to be effective in Orlando. The Bucks, who have had two players recently test positive for COVID and will need to distribute the shots effectively to still make a splash.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Moving into the season, the Celtics had some of the most explosive talent on the court today. With Tatum, Smart, Walker and Hayward, it was obvious that they could contend with the best of the East. Despite the fact that Hayward has made a graceful exit from Orlando, the raw talent alone of this team is enough to scare any opponent. They also have one of the premier coaches with Brad Steven who has been left alone for months on end, dreaming and scheming about only one thing, basketball. Can the mad genius pull out some magic in Orlando? Can Tacko Fall take the next step and become the dominating force in the paint the Celtics need?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        On the other hand, the Bucks have everything in place to win a title: the superstar, the coaching, the raw talent, veteran leadership and a cohesive unit. There can be little room to doubt that they have a shot to take home everything that Orlando has to offer. And there really is no better shot than now to win with this team – with an older team the opportunities are slim – even if that didn’t stop the Spurs from dominating earlier in the decade. The pressure is on and we’re excited to see how the team comes back together.

        Both teams match-up well and with a fresh set of legs and a lack of game time experience, we’re likely going to see a <i>ridiculously</i> high scoring affair.

	      Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge, Trey Lyles

      <p class="article">
        Can we be sure that the 2019-2020 Orlando San Antonio Spurs are not really the early 2010s Toronto Raptors in disguise? Let’s take a quick peek at the starting roster: Jakob Poeltl, DeMar DerRozan, Lonnie Walker, Derrick White, and Dejounte Murray. Outside of Texas, does anyone know who these people are? This roster looks like it was dug up by the Raptors out of desperation in the bad days just to field a team. Without LaMarcus, teams will be able to focus on DeMar and fully limit what he can do on the court. It was abundantly clear that in his time with Toronto, DeMar was never going to be the guy to carry a team on his own. That second piece is absolutely vital to his success. To be fair, the Spurs do have the most talented coach in the game and if there is any way he finds a victory, he will. But he’s playing with half a deck of cards. This team, much like the Nets, has no shot to win.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Now, if we look at the Kings you’ll find another mess. Can we dive into the Kings for more details? Sure. Should we? I don’t really think so. The Kings haven’t really put on a respectable roster in the last fifteen years. Why would Orlando be different? Buddy Healed has had his moments where he looks like the Golden God himself. But he also lost his starting spot to Bogdan. I don’t know where this team should be but it isn’t Orlando.

      <p class="article">
        The Houston Rockets score a lot of points. They have the best shooting guard in the game. They have the most explosive point guard over the last decade. They have the coaching to ensure they will always stay one step ahead (on the offensive end). And I hate watching them play. What do you consider to be beautiful basketball? Have you seen the crisp ball movement of the Spurs when Tony Parker was at the helm? Have you seen the stifling defense of the 2005 Pistons? There are a dozen different brands of “good” basketball. The Rockets definitely play good basketball, but they are so boring, as a team.

      <p class="article">
        Sure James Harden is exciting, Westbrook is a phenom. But the team?
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        Give me the watch-ability of the Mavericks any day of the week. Rick Carlyle brought one of the most unique teams in recent memory to the NBA finals and took a ship away from the Heatles. This man knows how to get the most out of his stars and it’s clear that he knows what to do with Luka and Kristoff.  Both teams have been high scoring and both teams are clearly some of the class the NBA has to offer its fans. But man do I just hate watching the Rockets play ball.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        After watching both of the first day games, I am much more convinced that sloppy ball will be played. And boy, who do you think will feast off of sloppy defense and a non-cohesive offense? I’m guessing that Harden and Westbrook combine for 90 in this game. Luka will definitely get his but if the team defense isn’t fully there for the Mavs, I think it will be impossible to stop the beard.
