      Milwaukee vs. Memphis
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    Memphis has been a major disappointment in the bubble. Partly due to injuries, and partly due to their overall play, they have dropped out of the 8 seed, after having a huge advantage over the teams trying to catch them. They’ve only won a game since play has resumed. Ja Morant hasn’t played as well as he is capable of, and the torn meniscus in Jackson’s knee obviously was a major blow to their playoff hopes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
      Today they match up against a Milwaukee team that will likely be sitting and forced to sit certain players. Giannis Antetokounmpo has been suspended one game for head-butting Mo Wagner (had it coming) and having secured the one seed, Coach Budenholzer will likely sit others as well. This is now a winnable game for Memphis, though I can still see them coming up short. They hold their own destiny. If they win the worst they can possibly be is the 9 seed. Lose and their chances are slim and would depend on the outcome of the Phoenix and San Antonio game.

      Dallas vs. Phoenix
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    Dallas is coming off the game of the bubble, losing by three to the Portland Trailblazers because of the best basketball performance of the year. Good news for Mavericks fans is that Porzingis looked great on the offensive end. Damian Lillard did torch him at every opportunity, but Lillard is playing at a level that no other player is on right now. If the Mavericks can unlock both Porzingis and Doncic, the Clippers could have a difficult time getting out of the first round.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
    Phoenix will be the focus of this game however, with Devin Booker and company going off for seven straight wins. They could potentially win today and still be out of the play-in, if the Memphis Grizzlies win. Booker has been a top three performer over the last few weeks, and has a ridiculously high usage rate right now. If he can keep it up, he gives his team a chance at their first postseason since 2009-2010.

    <p class="articleheading">
      San Antonio vs. Utah
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
  San Antonio needs the most help of any team. They need to win and have both Memphis and Phoenix lose in order to get the 9 seed. If Portland loses on top of this, then they could get the 8 seed. Along with the Suns, the Spurs have been the most pleasant surprise of the bubble. I always root for Demar Derozan (thanks for all you do surrounding mental health), and he’s playing at a much higher level now that Lamarcus Aldridge is out.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Their version of small ball (not even close to the Rockets) has been working wonders. They’ve stayed competitive in most games and have far exceeded expectations. They’ve earned a play-in spot just as much as any other team. We will see if luck smiles upon them today.

    <p class="articleheading">
      Portland vs. Brooklyn
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="article">
  Must watch television. Dame is putting on a show right now, and it’s worth tuning in just to see if he goes on another scoring tear. No one has scored 50 points in three straight games since Kobe Bryant in 2007. It’s not out of the realm of possibility either because Brooklyn is short-handed and the Trailblazers have to win the game. If they lose, they run the potential of being out of the play-in entirely.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      I can’t see Portland losing this game, but CJ McCollum’s back injury is going to hurt this team in the play-in games. He hasn’t looked like himself, not that anyone would with a fractured back. The pick and roll game with Nurkic and Lillard is now the team’s bread and butter, but CJ McCollum remains one of the best guards in the league. With him healthy they would have one, if not the best backcourt heading into the playoffs.
