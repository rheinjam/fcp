        Well, it sure was an interesting three months of NBA basketball. After daily testing, feelings of intense isolation, and other challenges for the players, we have a champion. The Los Angeles Lakers completed their quest to win one for Kobe and gave Lebron James a championship with his third team. This one clearly cements his legacy as either the first or second best basketball player of all time. In terms of career, it’s hard to say he hasn’t had the best career of any player. People will argue about Jordan and Lebron for years to come, but I think we should all just celebrate the greatness that is Lebron James. Winning his fourth championship in a bubble environment and being the best player on the floor at the age of 35 is nothing short of incredible. He may continue to keep winning as well, as the Lakers look primed to make another run next year. As long as you have Davis and James anything can happen.

      The bubble was a success. Zero positive covid tests and some of the most compelling basketball in recent years. No fan is going to forget Luka breaking out against the Clippers, Dame Lillard killing it to carry Portland to the playoffs, and the name Jamal Murray. Upsets were more prevalent in the bubble than anytime in the last decade of basketball, and the feeling that anyone could win added to the excitement. The movement for social justice also continued and NBA players continue to use their voice to bring about change. While ratings were down in part because of this, the players should be proud of trying to make the world a better place. Hopefully, now with the bubble over, players will continue to use their voice.

        It will be fascinating to see where the league goes from here. Latest discussions I have heard point to March being the month that the NBA owners are looking to restart. This is due to the fact that most owners would like fans in the stands before play resumes. In my mind, it’s completely up in the air. Will we have access to a vaccine or be able to safely be able to have fans below full capacity? Only time will tell and we should hopefully have some updates closer to the end of the year.
