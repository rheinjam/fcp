      The Utah Jazz have the Denver Nuggets number. No one expected the Jazz to make much noise in the bubble, but here we are. The Nuggets find themselves down 2-1, in large part due to the inability to stop the Gobert/Mitchell pick and roll. Jokic is still playing well on the offensive end, but his defense on Gobert, especially in game 3, has been atrocious. Open three pointers have rained down on the Nuggets and the rain has no signs of stopping anytime soon.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The Jazz continue to run multiple pick plays, one in which one screen is set, quickly followed by another one. It continues to throw off the Nuggets and gives the ball handler (usually Mitchell), a lane to head towards the basket. From there, the Jazz have options. They can shoot a floater, make a quick pass to Gobert, or pass out to a shooter if defenders converge. This play set along with superior ball movement is the main reason that the Jazz have the advantage currently.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
    The Nuggets have defenders right now that just aren’t moving their feet. In the modern N.B.A. there are a lot of players that don’t play defense, but Michael Porter Jr. and Jokic continue to get burned over and over again. Having not watched the Nuggets before the bubble, I’m not sure if Jokic is always this ineffective on defense, but Gobert’s energy is getting the better of him each game this series.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      The Nuggets need to fix these problems in this next game or they are going to find themselves in a serious hole. Effort goes a long way on defense and there were a few defensive sets that were more effective against the multiple screens that the Jazz were running against them. The problem is that their defensive scheme right now depends on their big and point guard communicating and I didn’t see a lot that happening in games two and three. If the Nuggets don’t come out with a clear intention to play better defense, this series is going to the Jazz.
