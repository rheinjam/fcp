        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Domantas Sabonis (plantar fasciitis -could miss rest of season), Victor Oladipo (ruptured quad tendon-scrimmaging with team, no decision yet as to whether he will play in the bubble)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Pacers have flown under the radar this season, as not many fans expected them to do much without star shooting guard Victor Oladipo, who was out for most of the season with a ruptured quad tendon. Oladipo returned in January and played a bit here and there on a minutes restriction, and the Pacers went 7-6 with him back on the team. At first, Oladipo stated he was opting out of Orlando. Now, he is practicing and scrimmaging with the team, but an unresolved salary dispute with the team might be the actual reason he traveled to the bubble. Both the team and Oladipo are keeping up appearances, but there could be some friction bubbling beneath the surface. As if that weren’t enough, all-star power forward Domantas Sabonis just left the bubble to receive treatment for plantar fasciitis, and the remainder of his season is in jeopardy. I feel a bit of déjà vu here.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) What is going on with Victor Oladipo? The all-star guard had a rough outing in his first scrimmage with the team, committing three turnovers and shooting 3-10 in 19 minutes. If Oladipo was already on the fence about playing, the injury to Sabonis could make that decision much easier for him, though he could remain with the team to ensure he collects the remaining 3 million dollars on his contract. 2) 3) Yet another three-point shooting question. Do the Pacers change their offensive style sans Sabonis? It’s an awfully short period of time to completely change your offensive system, but the Pacers do not have a reliable defensive option at the four without Domantis that can also shoot the three. Indiana was 30th in the NBA three-point attempts per game this year at only 27.5, but were 12th in the NBA in percentage at 36.3 percent. With their two best players either out or playing at less than 100%, don’t be surprised to see Indiana remove the spirit cuffs from their three-point shooters. This approach might be the only way to keep a series competitive.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First-round exit. The basketball gods have not smiled upon the Pacers this season. With Sabonis healthy and Oladipo potentially rounding back into form, Indiana was dark horse candidate to reach the conference finals. Without Sabonis and the Oladipo situation looking more and more awkward, this team will be very lucky to even push a series past 5 games with Miami or Boston likely looming. Back healthy next year, this Indiana team will be a problem.

      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The Magic have a shot to make the playoffs for the second straight season and are a young team building for the future. They took a huge gamble on obtaining former number 1 overall draft pick Markelle Fultz, whose shooting/injury injuries were well-documented in Philadelphia. Lead by walking double-double Nikola Vucevic, the Magic are top ten in the league in defensive rating (9th), but struggle on the other end (24th in offensive rating). Orlando is a team that remains in flux, but has already built an identity as a solid defensive squad.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) How will the NBA deal with the debut of Swole Bamba? Mo put on about 28 pounds since the quarantine began (his own words) and the 22-year-old now looks like he’s ready to body slam Rocky Balboa in a charity fight that gets a little out of hand. Already one of the NBA’s best defensive bigs and the most famous player on the team, how much longer can the Magic afford to bring Bamba off the bench? 2) What can Markelle Fultz provide in his first playoff series as a starter? Assuming he is ready to go, Fultz has had a nice comeback season after a very difficult introduction to the league, averaging 12.1 points, 5.2 assists, and 1.3 steals on 47% from the field. He still struggles to shoot the three, which puts a ceiling on his potential as a starter, but this first-round series could have a major impact on his career trajectory. 3) Can the Magic avoid the Milwaukee buzz saw? While it doesn’t seem as though this team can score enough or shoot well enough (25th in the league in 3pt percentage) to make a series competitive against the top teams in the East, they’d have a better shot if they avoided Milwaukee. The Bucks swept the Magic this season, and none of those contests were particularly close. Moving up one spot to the seventh seed isn’t out of the question, as the Magic get to play the depleted Brooklyn Nets twice, but Orlando will have to hit the ground running.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First-round exit. Regardless of Orlando’s first-round opponent, it’s difficult to see them forcing a top East team into any sort of elimination situation. Orlando just doesn’t score enough points to keep things competitive against the elite teams. Given this fact, if Orlando somehow misses out on the 8th seed (an unlikely proposition), a ticket in the lottery might not be the worst thing in the world for this franchise. Luckily for the Magic, it’s a short drive home from the Disney campus for many of their players.

        W’s where we are with the Nets at this point. Rebuilding its roster nicely after getting fleeced by Danny Ainge and the Celtics years ago, trading for the zombified versions of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, the Nets are biding their time until Durant and Irving are healthy and on the floor together. That time is not now, and other key members of the roster opted out, likely realizing the writing was on the wall for this season. With a depleted roster, the bubble is more about the franchise getting a look at some of the less-played guys and recent additions rather than making a deep playoff run. It’s difficult to pull any statistics from this season when discussing the Nets, as this simply isn’t the same team. They did sign a guy that scored 51 points in his last NBA game in Jamal Crawford, so that could be fun (not too bad for a 40-year-old, huh?).
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> Can Tyler Johnson revive his NBA career? The Phoenix Suns waived a struggling Johnson earlier this season, but he put on a show in his first scrimmage with the Nets (17 points on 7-11 shooting). Johnson could use the Orlando bubble as a launching pad back into an NBA rotation next year. 2) Can Brooklyn win a game in the first round? While just a scrimmage, the Nets lost by 31 points to the Zion Williamson-less Pelicans in their first exhibition game. As usual, Wolverine Caris LeVert got buckets, dropping 27 in a lopsided contest. The Nets looked better in their second scrimmage, but it is difficult to imagine a scenario wherein the Nets can make a series competitive. 3)   If Brooklyn free falls far enough, they could find themselves even out of a play-in scenario. As with the Magic, a better draft pick might not be a bad thing for the Nets at this point.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> First-round exit. There is an excellent chance that Brooklyn ends up with the 8 seed or even out of the playoffs, though Washington would have to catch fire to pull that off. Either way, this depleted team will struggle against just about anyone. LeVert, Crawford, Joe Harris, and Johnson would all have to go absolutely crazy from deep to win a game or two in the playoffs. If the Pacers are the Jazz of the East, the Brooklyn Nets are a notch below that. Side note: I am fully prepared to endure the wrath of Utah fans if Quin Snyder’s squad wins a round.

      <p class="article">
        Another pleasant surprise this season, Miami has leapt from 10th in the East last year up to 4th this season. A huge part of this, and a huge part of their identity, is their elite three-point shooting. Miami has shot a league-best 38.3% from three this season,  by unlikely marksman Duncan Robinson, who shoots a staggering 44.8% from three on 8.4 attempts per game. Nunn, Crowder, Dragic, Herro, Leonard, Olynyk… this team is stacked with shooters. They’re also fourth in free throw attempts per game. Coach Erik Spoelstra has truly embraced the modern NBA ethos of free throws and threes, and it has led to a jump from 26th in offensive rating last season to 6th this season. If Miami continues its hot shooting and doesn’t turn the ball over (they play at a snail’s pace), they could make life very difficult for the rest of the East.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can this team defend and rebound well enough to survive the increased physicality of the playoffs? The Heat are perfectly constructed to rack up regular season wins with their shooting, spacing, and zone defense, but allow opposing teams to grab the second most rebounds per game, allow the seventh highest opposing field goal percentage, and are only 20th in forcing opponent turnovers. Unless Miami’s shooting is scorching hot, those numbers will need to improve. 2) Will Jimmy Butler prove he can be the best player on a team making a deep playoff run? While not a major three-point threat, Jimmy Buckets does everything else well, posting 20.2 points, 6.1 assists, 6.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals on 45.4% shooting from the field. He also gets to the line 9.1 times per game, a career high, and converts at an 83% clip. A better-than-expected playoff performance from Miami could vault Butler from a top-20 player up into the top 10 or 15. 3) Is Kendrick Nunn ready for the playoff spotlight? The rookie guard out of Oakland U has been key to Miami’s success this season, averaging 15.6 PPG on solid shooting splits, especially for a 6-foot-2 guard brand new to the league. Only Ja Morant has scored more out the NBA rookie class. Asking Nunn to keep up that same level of production and efficiency is a lot to ask against the elite defenses in the East.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Second-round or first-round loss. Seemingly every move Miami made this offseason has turned to gold, but Miami relies an awful lot on inexperienced talent (Nunn, Herro, Adebayo, Robinson), and a zone defense that teams will be better prepared to face in the playoffs. This projection is dependent upon seeding. If Miami matches up with Indiana in the first round, expect the Heat to make short work of the shorthanded Pacers.  I fully understand Miami as a popular dark horse pick in the East, but I just see don’t see enough experience and defense on this promising young team, and too many individual defensive matchups that savvy teams will be able to attack.

        <b>Projection:</b> Misses playoffs. The Wizards are 5.5 games back of the 8-seed Magic, 6 games back of the Nets, and are bringing a depleted roster to Orlando. I won’t sugarcoat it, folks. These Wizards will look more like Muggles without Beal and Bertans in the starting lineup. Even with those guys, Washington was 16 games below .500, winning only 37% of its games. The only shot Washington has to force a play-in is if they play enough play-in games against teams that decide to rest key players. Even then, most NBA benches would be favored against t his squad in its current form. These Dursleys will need more than a little magic to unseat Orlando for the 8th seed.

        The mighty Bucks have a lot going for them: 1) the likely league MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo; 2) the NBA’s top defense (101.9 defensive rating, best in the league); and 3) a very good offense (7th in offensive rating, 1st in points per game). This is the second-best roster (on paper) in the league behind only the Clippers. Surveying the stats, the only apparent holes in Giannis’ game this point are his free throw shooting (66% on 10 attempts per game) and his three-point shooting (30% on 4.8 attempts per game). This team is fast, athletic, motivated, and experienced. How to beat them, you ask? Slow the pace of the game down, don’t turn the ball over, and force Giannis to shoot over a set defense. Much easier said than done if you don’t have Kawhi Leonard on your team.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) How will Milwaukee fare in the playoffs without Malcom Brogdon? Brogdon provided ball handling, playmaking, and shooting off the bench in last year’s run to the conference finals, but landed a nice contract in Indiana this season. Outside of Khris Middleton, the Bucks haven’t had a consistent third playmaker in 2019-2020, as Eric Bledsoe continues to be up and down and is coming off of a COVID-19 diagnosis. 2) Can Giannis shake the ghosts from last year’s playoff loss? In the decisive game 6 against the Raptors last season, the Greek Freak shot only 38.9% from the field and bricked 5 of 10 free throws as the team blew a 2-0 series lead, losing four straight games. The East does not boast a player of Kawhi Leonard’s caliber in the playoffs this season, so this might be Giannis’ best chance to break through before Kevin Durant and the Nets are healthy next season. 3) Can the Antetokounmpo and Lopez brothers become the first siblings to ever win an NBA title together? The chances of one set of siblings winning a title on the same team are already astronomically low. Now try throwing in a separate pair of siblings to the mix that also just so happen to be twins! If the Bucks hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy, expect this to become the most unbreakable NBA record this side of a Wilt Chamberlain points per game average.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> NBA Finals. In the NBA playoffs, great teams must experience the sting of defeat before improving and moving on to the promised land. The Bad Boy Pistons and 90’s Bulls both had to experience this torment at the hands of more experienced squads, and the Bucks have now endured the same thing. While Boston or Philly could push Milwaukee to a seventh game and maybe even an upset, Milwaukee is rightfully the heavy favorite to win the East and will have a puncher’s chance to raise a banner when it’s all said and done, but Giannis will have to prove that he’s learned to think the game like an all-time great to supplement the all-time talent he already possesses.

        A team many thought would regress this season, the hoisters of the 2019 Larry O’Brien Trophy just keep chugging along. I’m including the Raptors in the “favorites” section because they are the defending champs. Until another team unseats them, regardless of the departure of a superstar, they have earned the designation of a “favorite.” Toronto’s record played out that way too, as they put up the third best record in the NBA this season (the same record as last season through the same number of games), behind only the Bucks and Lakers. Just because Kawhi is gone doesn’t mean the Raptors aren’t a threat. The Raptors were second in the NBA in defensive rating and were a respectable 12th in the league in points per game. Toronto boasts a rising young Swiss army knife of a star in Pascal Siakam, and veteran mainstays Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka, and Marc Gasol.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can Pascal Siakam take over where Kawhi Leonard left off? With Leonard departing for Los Angeles, Toronto is left looking for someone to replace his elite production on both ends, as well as a guy who can create his own shot against a set defense late in playoff games. Siakam has been great this season, but we don’t know what he’ll look like as the go-to guy late in a physical series. 2) How much do Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol have left in the tank? Lowry is now 34 years old, but his scoring numbers and shooting percentages have actually increased this season from last season, taking on more usage sans-Kawhi. Gasol is now 35 and has seen his scoring and shooting splits go down from last year, partially due to an injury. However, like Lowry did earlier in his career, Gasol significantly slimmed down over the quarantine. These two vets will have to avoid fatigue and injury for Toronto to reach the conference finals. 3) Can Toronto continue to pilfer the rock and get out in transition? The Raptors are 2nd in the NBA in steals per game and were excellent at turning those miscues into transition buckets. Surprisingly, even with the Claw in the lineup last season, Toronto was only 9th in steals that year. As the level of play increases with the start of the playoffs, those turnovers could be harder to come by. Without a superstar that can generate points at will, it will be crucial for Toronto to continue to generate easy offense with its defense.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Second-round loss. Despite their designation as a favorite, Leonard’s presence last season is what took Toronto from being a solid team to a special team. Even with Kawhi on the team and a younger Lowry, Ibaka, and Gasol, it still took a game-winner in a 7-game series against Philly for the Raptors to reach the conference finals last year. Without Kawhi scoring an efficient 30 points per game and providing elite defense, the Raptors could be vulnerable in the second round. If the current standings were to hold, Toronto would have to play either Boston or Philly, both teams that have the potential to pull off the upset. Don’t sleep on the Raptors though, as they still have the talent and veteran leadership to reach the Finals if they get a bit of luck on their side, and any victory over this team will be hard-earned.

        Bubble Losses/Injuries: Kemba Walker (knee injury- day to day, expected to play)
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        A perennial threat in the East, Boston is not being talked about as a realistic title contender after the Kyrie Irving experiment crashed and burned last season and Gordon Hayward experienced ups and downs this season attempting to return from the fractured ankle he suffered in his 2018 Boston debut. Irving’s replacement, Kemba Walker, has shot it well from three this year at 37.7%, but his overall field goal percentage and assists per game are down from his time in Charlotte. He continues to work his way back into game shape, but should be ready to go. Forward Jason Tatum appeared to be taking a step forward before the lockdown, averaging nearly 8 more points per game this season than last season (23.6) and improving his rebounding, block, and steal numbers. While a small team compared to past Boston outfits, the Celtics are very good on both ends, posting top-five offensive and defensive ratings per Basketball Reference. The pace-and-space offense seems to be paying off for Boston, but it remains to be seen whether they can deal with the superior size of some other East teams over the course of a seven-game series.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        <b>Key Questions:</b> 1) Can Boston get away with its lack of size? The C’s are starting Hayward at the four and Daniel Theis at the five, neither of which are hulking rim protectors. Surprisingly, the answer might be yes, as Boston ranks 9th in the league in rebounding and 6th in the league in blocks. With that being said, it’s not clear whether the Celtic front line will be able to deal with the size of Milwaukee on the glass (who outrebounded them in both games this season), or the Sixers (who went 3-1 vs Boston this year). Steven Adams putting up 17 and 7 on 8-11 shooting in only 15 minutes against Boston in the first scrimmage was not an encouraging sign. 2) Will Jason Tatum take the leap to superstardom? As noted above, he’s mostly maintained his efficiency while taking on more of a scoring load this season. Without former mainstay Al Horford providing paint protection and outside shooting, Tatum will need to solidify himself as a top ten type of player if Boston hopes to make a run to the Finals. 3) Will Boston survive a potential absence from Gordon Hayward? He’s expecting the birth of a child in September and plans to leave the bubble. He’ll then have to go quarantine once he returns, missing additional time. A loss of a starter for any significant period of time could completely swing a series.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Second-round exit. I really like the chemistry and fight of this Boston team, as Kemba Walker is the type of personality players can rally around and Tatum looks like he’s just about to take his game to a new level. Unfortunately, there are just too many question marks here to predict a conference finals appearance for Boston with Kemba’s health, Hayward missing some games, and Boston’s lack of beef on the front line. This is a team that could go to the Finals or lose to Philadelphia in the first round. Avoiding the 76ers in round one would be huge for Boston.

        Philly is an easy team to spin. Those bullish on the Sixers can point to the miraculous game-winner it took for the eventual champion Raptors to eliminate them last season, while their detractors can rehash Ben Simmons’ shooting woes, Embiid’s conditioning and health, and the difficulty Philly has had getting an offense together that highlights its strengths (17th in offensive rating this season). It is tough to ignore the talent on this team though, and with their 3-1 record vs Boston in the regular season, all it might take is a revenge series against an experienced but Kawhi-less Toronto to punch Philly a ticket to the Eastern Conference Finals. This might be the highest risk/highest reward team in the East, as this club was dominant at home (29-2) and just plain bad on the road (10-24). Who knows how that record disparity translates to a neutral playing site with pumped-in crowd noise and no fans.

        <b>Key Questions:</b> How will the Simmons at power forward experiment play out? A major talking point leading into the bubble, the Sixers moved Al Horford to the bench in February, moving Simmons to the power forward spot and guard Shake Milton to the point. We never really got to see the results play out, as Simmons dealt with a back injury, bringing Horford back in, and COVID-19 hit shortly thereafter. This switch could improve the Sixers’ spacing and scoring, but is also a risk given the short turnaround before the playoffs begin. 2) Will Shake shake things up? Second-year guard Shake Milton (an all-time great NBA name) came on strong just before the lockdown, including a 39-point, 7-9 from 3 performance against the Clippers on March 1 amid a string of seven straight double-digit scoring efforts. It’s not fair to expect Shake to play at an all-star level this early, but if he’s even above average, Philadelphia will be a matchup in the East no one wants to see. 3) Is Coach Brett Brown capable of getting this team to the next level? Brown is taking a big risk with this lineup change, one that would have had more of an opportunity to play out naturally but for the lockdown. If the Sixers exit the playoffs in the second round or earlier this year, Brown could be out of a job. In the event that occurs, it will be interesting to dissect whether the problem all along was Brown’s scheme or simply roster fit.
      <p class="article">
        <b>Projection:</b> Conference finals. Fire up the Robinhood account, call the bookie, and let’s get ready to gamble! Perhaps against my better judgment, I think Philly has the talent, size, and motivation to reach the conference finals this season, and maybe even beyond. Brett Brown is likely coaching for his job, and Embiid and Simmons are playing for their reputations. Boston has a hard time dealing with Philly’s size, and I like Philly’s chances against an inexperienced Miami team with question marks on the defensive end. Of course, this prediction is predicated upon the Simmons position move working out, which I believe it will. Simmons can still trigger the Philly fast break when he grabs a defensive rebound, and the offense should look more coherent without three bigs clogging up the floor spacing. Horford is as good a bench big as a playoff team could ask for and could plug the hole in the dam for stretches if Embiid struggles with conditioning or injuries.
