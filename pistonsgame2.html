        The Detroit Pistons, coming off a loss to the Timberwolves two nights earlier, had their home opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers last night. It was another reminder that this is going to be a long season for Pistons fans. Killian Hayes continues to disappoint. It’s not fair to expect the world from him, but everyone was hoping for more than they are seeing from the 19 year old rookie. His lack of assertiveness prompted Dwane Casey to pull him early in both games played so far. Hopefully, he can improve as the season continues and can be relied on. Otherwise, the onus will continue to fall on Derrick Rose to carry this bizarre roster.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The first quarter saw numerous turnovers and a shot clock violation. Thankfully, Blake Griffin was hitting some early threes to keep the Pistons in it. Surprisingly, Mason Plumlee continues to be a bright spot for the team, as he scored a couple of difficult baskets early on. Cavaliers turnovers also contributed to a close game, as they had six turnovers in the first eight minutes of play.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        The second quarter saw some of the worst defensive lapses I’ve seen from the Pistons in some time. One sequence, in particular, saw Javale McGee grab a rebound, dribble it all the way to the opposite basket and dunk the ball. If the Pistons continue to not stop the ball and allow easy layups and dunks, they will not win many games this season. The Cavaliers went into the half with a small lead, in large part due to the poor defense of the Pistons.

      <p class="article">
        In the second half of the game, the Cavaliers built upon their small halftime lead. But the Pistons countered, showing some resilience. Blake Griffin may have lost his athleticism, but he found his shooting stroke. He hit 8 three pointers in the game, with several of them coming in the third quarter. The Pistons had this game in hand, but the inability to get a basket down the stretch hurt them. This coupled with no one being able to stop Andre Drummond without fouling him. The Pistons were lucky in the fact that he shot so poorly from the field because he was shooting uncontested shots for the majority of the night. Drummond also had a chance at a potential game winning tip, but came up just short. It should be mentioned that this was before an inexcusable 24 second shot violation and Pistons turnover with five seconds to go in the game.
      </p>
      <p class="article">
        This game should have been over a few times, but ended up getting dragged out. The Pistons built a large lead in the first overtime and the Cavaliers appeared sunk. But then the Pistons gifted them easy three pointers and layups, along with two turnovers by Derrick Rose. The second overtime was the opposite of the first with the Cavaliers jumping out to an early lead. This time, however, the other team could not catch up. The Pistons night was done. My girlfriend had this to say about the game. “It was terrible.” She was right.
