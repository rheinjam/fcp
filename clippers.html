    By James Rhein
    <p class="article">
      I’ve seen some miraculous comebacks over the years, but this has to be at the top of the list. The Nuggets, again down 3-1 in a series, managed to upset the L.A. Clippers in 7 games. Backed by incredible performances from Jokic and Murray, the Nuggets played a second half for the ages, not allowing the Clippers to score for several minutes in the 4th quarter. Clippers fans have to be shaking their heads, wondering how their best team ever on paper managed to lose three games in a row.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Let’s start with Paul George. For much of this series he looked like the player he is supposed to be. Solid wing defender who can score the ball at will. In Game 7 he completely fell apart, at one point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkQFaeRRSc" target="_blank"> hitting the side of the backboard. </a> You can’t go 2 for 11 from downtown in the most meaningful game of the season. I could even overlook this, if he had been more aggressive getting to the hole and hadn’t had five turnovers. Is a trade in Paul George’s future? Time will tell, but don’t expect teams to be throwing draft picks or any talented players the Clippers way.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
    Next, we also need to mention Kawhi Leonard. He came up so huge last year down the stretch and hit arguably the most memorable shot in Game 7 history last year. This year was anything but that. He shot 6 for 22 from the field, and looked gassed down the stretch. A report came out on Bleacher Report that several players asked to be taken out in the second half of the game for a breather. I’m not sure if Kawhi was one of them, but boy did he need it. He’s going to be unfairly criticised for the next few days, with several people talking about how this game is going to tarnish his legacy. It doesn’t make him look great, but people need to remember that he has a pair of Finals MVPs and two championships. I expect him to stick around with the Clippers.

    Doc Rivers. People were saying he was on the hot seat. He has a ring, but since then (10+ years ago) he has not had much playoff success. I can see this situation going either way, but without great coaching options elsewhere, he may be sticking around. Doc seems to be a great person, but this might be the end of his coaching career with the Clippers. After this debacle someone has to take the fall and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SXWX6qg0y4" target="_blank">it may very well be him.</a>

    Well, at least now Lou Williams can get his hot wings.
