      The Ejection

      Game 1 is in the books and boy was it frustrating. The Clippers pulled out a victory, thanks in large part to the refs and poor late game shooting by the Mavericks. At the beginning of the game, one would think that the game was going to be a blowout, with the Clippers jumping out to an early lead. They were clamping down on defense and forced Luka Doncic into 5 first quarter turnovers. There was also a scare for all Mavericks fans when it appeared as though Doncic landed awkwardly on his ankle. Thankfully, he was able to come back into the game and looked every bit himself. He found open teammates when doubled, and was able to coast to the basket at will. On a side note, I continue to be impressed with Doncic’s play. If he becomes a better three point shooter he will be an offensive weapon on the level of James Harden.

      As the game continued and Luka came back, the Mavericks were able to climb back. They got hot from downtown and the Clippers defense lapsed on multiple occasions. Reggie Jackson was hilariously bad at the end of the second quarter, and as a Pistons fan I felt the pain of all Clipper fans. He’s always been a decent scorer, but his decision making is questionable at best. The Mavericks had a small lead at halftime.

      The third quarter is where the game changed for the worse and infuriated most people watching. Kristaps Porzingis was ejected after picking up a second technical foul, both fouls being weak. Even the Clippers’ coach Doc Rivers thought that the ejection was taking it too far. Porzingis is the second most important piece on the Mavericks and without him, leaves them unable to protect the rim. Boban tried to play defense in his place, but he remains a liability on that end. I’m glad that the Mavericks were able to stay competitive after the ejection, but this ejection likely cost them the chance of winning. The series would be completely changed if the Mavericks had stolen game one.

      The end of the game kept me invested, but Dallas became cold from the three point line, while the Clippers did the opposite. Luka finished with the most points ever in a playoff debut, and both Kawhi and P.G. finished the game strong. This is a series that had the chance of being one of the better first round series, but the ejection of Porzingis has likely guaranteed that this series is not going to go the distance.
