      The first few days of the bubble have been nothing short of a disaster for the Pelicans. A couple of days ago, this team was a popular pick to make a run at the 8 seed with superstar rookie Zion Williamson returning to the bubble in the nick of time following an absence due to a personal issue. Lonzo Ball was having the best shooting season of his career, Brandon Ingram made the leap to all-star status, and Jrue Holiday continued his great defense and experienced scoring and playmaking. Throw in an Instagram picture of Zion looking trim and, well, freaking huge, and many folks were hopping on the bandwagon despite teams like Memphis and Portland standing in the way.

      Things started great for New Orleans against the Jazz on July 30th, with the Pelicans taking a 12-point lead at halftime and an 8-point lead into the fourth quarter. With 7:19 left in the fourth quarter, the Jazz had battled back to cut the lead to 89-93. Zion Williamson then exited the game and would never return due to a strict 15-per-game minutes restriction. The Jazz then took control, eventually getting a short jumper, three free throws and another jumper from Donovan Mitchell to give them the lead for good. Lonzo Ball shot 2-13 in this game, including 0-4 from three, Jrue Holiday had 6 turnovers and J.J. Redick chipped in 3 giveaways. Zion’s defense was also lackluster, playing into his -16 +/- while he was on the court. A loss against the Jazz to start the bubble was less than ideal, as that was a winnable game for New Orleans due to the Jazz missing a 20 ppg starter and dealing with ongoing chemistry issues.

      Fast forward to Saturday. A matchup with the juggernaut Clippers was a must-win for the Pelicans, especially with the 9th ranked Blazers securing a win against Memphis in their first game. I expected both teams to come out swinging, but this game got out of hand quickly. L.A. rained in a staggering 9 three pointers in the first quarter alone, racking up 37 points. It only got worse from there, as the Clippers poured in 40 points in the second quarter. At halftime, the Clippers enjoyed a 77-45 lead. This one was already over. A dejected J.J. Redick sideline shot spiraled into an internet meme and the Pelicans’ playoff chances spiraled down along with it. New Orleans would bring the final score within 25 points by the game’s end, but the damage was already done. The Clippers finished the game shooting 25-47 from three-point range, an absurd 42.5%.

      It’s possible that this game was a statistical anomaly, one that New Orleans’ effort level would not have changed. Regardless, it highlights how the team’s refusal to play its franchise player just a few more minutes in the first game to secure an important win may have doomed it in the playoff race. New Orleans is now down to 12th in the conference standings, trailing Memphis, Portland, San Antonio, and Sacramento. The silver lining here is that New Orleans doesn’t exactly have a murderers’ row of a remaining schedule, with Memphis, Sacramento, the Washington Generals, San Antonio, Sacramento again, and Orlando remaining on the docket. However, this could hurt New Orleans, as the top seeded teams in each conference will likely rest players once their seeding is locked in, which would give New Orleans a chance to play against the bench players of said teams. Memphis, San Antonio, Orlando, and Sacramento are all in seeding battles and have heavy incentive to win these games and play their best players. Not a good sign for a New Orleans team with its star not playing when it matters most.

      Overall, the Zion minutes restriction makes me wonder whether GM David Griffin was okay with not making the playoffs this season, instead opting for a ticket to the draft lottery. The Ringer has the Pels’ 9-seed chances down to 19% for a play-in and its 8-seed chances for a play-in down to only 5%, with both Portland and San Antonio in superior statistical positions. The Pelicans now only have an outside chance of making the playoffs, but adding a more talented piece to this roster might be more valuable long-term than losing to the Lakers in 5 or 6 games in the first round. Unlike the leadership in other franchises (*cough* Detroit *cough*), Griffin is shrewd enough to understand that serving as a sacrificial lamb to a 1-seed provides little value to a team. For us lucky NBA fans, we’ll still enjoy an entertaining series with LeBron and AD matched up against Ja and Jaren or Dame and CJ. While this negative press may hurt right now, fear not, Pelican fans… your time is coming.
