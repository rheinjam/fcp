    By James Rhein
    <p class="article">
      Most of the first round series appear to be at their end, with the winner nearly decided in each . The one exception in my mind is the Rockets and Thunder series. The first two games easily went to the Rockets, shooting a high percentage from three point land, and taking advantage of their speed. The Thunder have played Steven Adams a significant number of minutes and he has appeared to hurt the team at stretches. Only when the Thunder miraculously forced an overtime period in game three did they figure something out. They then went on to win both games three and four.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Small ball can beat the Rockets. Using Alexander, Schroder, and Paul in crunch time minutes, and incorporating other guards in the lineup makes them more efficient than any lineup the Rockets currently have. They depend so much on the analytics of basketball, having made their roster based on three point percentage, as well as a few other factors. James Harden played at the usual high level that he does and it still wasn’t enough. He showed visible frustration after the game and knows that the rest of this series is going to push his team to its physical and mental limits.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
    I’m reaching my mental limit as well because it’s extremely boring to watch. When the Golden State Warriors helped bring about a three point revolution it was the most entertaining basketball in recent memory. Years later, we are seeing the negative effects of the added significance of three point shooting. Teams shoot more threes than ever, especially the Rockets who are shooting at historically high numbers. I miss the days where the league was more defensive focused and not every game felt like an All Star game. As we’ve seen is this bubble scoring 50 points no longer seems like something special. Players are putting up incredible stat lines night in and night out. The mystery of the game has died and the Rockets are contributing to its death.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
  Russell Westbrook is back for the Rockets for game 5. Will he make an impact right away? Will the Rockets be able to stay hot from downtown? Will they find a way to slow down the Thunder? I can see this series going either way. Both teams play similar games and while more players on the Thunder can generate their own offense, the Rockets could easily shoot their way to a series win.
